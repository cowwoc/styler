/**
 * JMH performance benchmarks for Styler.
 *
 * This package contains comprehensive performance benchmarks validating the performance claims
 * documented in the project scope. Benchmarks are organized by category: parsing, memory, formatting,
 * scalability, threading, and real-world project processing.
 *
 * All benchmarks use JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) with rigorous statistical configurations
 * (3 forks, 5 warmup iterations, 10 measurement iterations) to ensure reliable, reproducible results.
