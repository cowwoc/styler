# Styler Source-Available Commercial License

Version 1.0.0

## Hi! Here's what you need to know:

**Free for personal use** - Tinkering on a side project? Learning to code?
Doing research? Go for it, no strings attached.

**Free for small organizations** - If your org makes less than $100K/year,
you're welcome to use Styler at no cost.

**Commercial use needs a license** - Working at a company? Using this for
paying clients? You'll need to purchase a license. It helps keep the project
sustainable.

**Building a product with Styler?**
- If your product runs Styler for your users (like a code formatting SaaS),
  each user needs their own license.
- If you're just using Styler internally to keep your own codebase tidy,
  your customers don't need licenses - only your team does.

**About forks** - If someone forks Styler, commercial users still need to
get their license from me (the original author). This keeps things fair and
prevents someone from just repackaging the project.

**The fine print** - No warranty, and if you break the rules you lose your
license. The legal details are below.

## Legal Terms

The following sections contain the legally binding license terms.

## Acceptance

To use, copy, modify, or distribute this software, you must accept these
license terms.

## Definitions

**"Software"** means the Styler Java Code Formatter and all associated source
code, documentation, and related files in this repository.

**"Licensor"** means the original author and copyright holder of the Software.

**"You"** means the individual or entity exercising rights under this license.

**"Personal Use"** means use by an individual for personal, educational,
research, experimental, or hobby purposes, where the use is not intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

**"Commercial Use"** means any use of the Software that is primarily intended
for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation. This
includes, but is not limited to:
- Use by a for-profit company or organization
- Use by employees or contractors in the course of their employment
- Use in developing, testing, or deploying commercial products or services
- Use in providing paid consulting or professional services
- Use by any organization (including non-profits) with annual revenue or
  funding exceeding $100,000 USD

**"Derivative Work"** means any work that is based on or derived from the
Software, including modifications, translations, adaptations, and works
that incorporate substantial portions of the Software.

## Grant of Rights for Personal Use

Subject to the terms of this license, the Licensor grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:

1. Use the Software for Personal Use
2. Copy and distribute the Software for Personal Use
3. Modify the Software and create Derivative Works for Personal Use
4. Distribute Derivative Works for Personal Use

## Commercial Use Requires a Paid License

**Commercial Use of the Software requires a separate paid license from the
Licensor.**

If You wish to use the Software for Commercial Use, You must purchase a
commercial license directly from the Licensor. Contact the Licensor for
pricing and terms.

## Runtime Redistribution Requires Per-User Licensing

**"Runtime Redistribution"** means incorporating the Software into a product
or service that invokes the Software on behalf of end users at runtime.

If Your product or service performs Runtime Redistribution, **each end user
who benefits from the Software's functionality must have their own valid
commercial license from the Licensor.**

Examples:
- A SaaS code formatting service that uses Styler → each user needs a license
- A hosted IDE that invokes Styler for users → each user needs a license
- A CI/CD platform that runs Styler for customers → each customer needs a license

**Internal tooling exception**: If Your organization uses Styler solely for
internal development purposes (e.g., formatting Your own codebase during
build), and Your product does not invoke Styler at runtime for end users,
then Your end users do not require their own licenses.

## Derivative Works and Commercial Use

**Commercial Use of any Derivative Work also requires a paid license from
the original Licensor (not the creator of the Derivative Work).**

If You create a Derivative Work and another party wishes to use that
Derivative Work for Commercial Use, that party must obtain a commercial
license from the original Licensor. Fork maintainers and Derivative Work
creators cannot grant commercial use rights.

This ensures that:
- The original author is compensated for all Commercial Use
- Fork maintainers cannot commercially exploit the original work
- Commercial users always know to contact the original Licensor

## Conditions

You must:

1. **Preserve Notices**: Keep all copyright, license, and attribution notices
   intact in all copies and Derivative Works.

2. **Include License**: Distribute copies of this license with any
   distribution of the Software or Derivative Works.

3. **State Changes**: If You distribute a Derivative Work, clearly indicate
   that changes were made and provide attribution to the original Software.

4. **No Trademark Rights**: This license does not grant any rights to use the
   Licensor's trademarks, trade names, or service marks.

## No Circumvention

You may not:

1. Remove, alter, or obscure any licensing or copyright notices
2. Use technical measures to restrict others from exercising rights under
   this license that they would otherwise have
3. Sublicense the Software or grant commercial use rights to third parties

## Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. THE LICENSOR MAKES
NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Termination

Your rights under this license terminate automatically if You fail to comply
with any of its terms. Upon termination, You must cease all use and
distribution of the Software and destroy all copies in Your possession.

## No Automatic Conversion

This license does not contain any provision for automatic conversion to an
open-source license. The terms of this license remain in effect indefinitely
unless explicitly changed by the Licensor through a new license version.

## Governing Law

This license shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides, without regard to its
conflict of law provisions.
