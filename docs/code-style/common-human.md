## üß† Philosophy: Code as Communication

Code is written once but read many times. In a code formatter handling AST transformations, clarity and
maintainability are critical because:
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple developers work on parser logic and formatting rules
- **Language evolution**: Java language features change with each release, requiring clear, modifiable code
- **Long-term maintenance**: Formatters must support legacy and cutting-edge language features simultaneously

## üö® TIER 1 CRITICAL - Build Blockers



## ‚ö†Ô∏è TIER 2 IMPORTANT - Code Review

### Magic Strings - Hardcoded Values
**Why problematic in parsers**: Hardcoded strings often represent language constructs that change over time.
Parser error messages, token names, and language keywords need to be easily updateable.

**Maintenance burden**: Scattered strings make it difficult to update messaging when language specifications
change.

**Localization considerations**: Code formatters may need to support multiple languages for error messages and
user-facing text.

## üí° TIER 3 QUALITY - Best Practices

### Code Duplication - Repeated Logic Blocks
**Why extract common functionality**: Parser operations often involve similar patterns (token validation, AST
construction, error handling). Shared utilities ensure consistent behavior and easier maintenance.

**Testing benefits**: Shared functions can be unit tested once and reused confidently throughout the code
formatting system.

**Language updates**: When Java language features or grammar rules change, having logic in one place makes
updates safer and more reliable.

### Comments - Obvious Statements
**When to comment parser code**:
- **Grammar rules**: "Apply precedence rules for binary operators per JLS ¬ß15.7"
- **Language references**: "Based on Java Language Specification ¬ß14.9"
- **Complex transformations**: "AST restructuring for method reference expressions per JLS ¬ß15.13"

**When not to comment**: Basic programming operations that are self-evident from well-named variables and
methods.

### Comments - Inline Placement
**Why comments should precede code**: Inline comments interrupt the flow of reading code and make lines
longer, reducing readability especially on smaller screens.

**Parser code readability**: AST transformation logic is already complex. Comments should enhance
understanding, not clutter the logical flow.

**Best practice**: Place explanatory comments on the line above the code they describe, allowing the eye to
read explanation first, then implementation.

### Comments - Historical References
**Why avoid historical comments**: Code should document the current state, not past decisions. Version control
systems (git) provide complete change history.

**Maintenance burden**: Historical comments become stale and misleading as code evolves. They add cognitive
overhead without functional value.

**Parser code focus**: Code formatting logic should focus on current language specifications, not previous
implementations or future possibilities.

**Parser code clarity**: Well-written parser code should read like a description of the transformation
process, with comments reserved for language specification context rather than programming mechanics.

### Language-Specific Implementation

These common principles apply universally, but specific implementation details vary by language:
- **[Java Style Guide](java-human.md)**: AST validation and parsing exception handling patterns
- **[TypeScript Style Guide](typescript-human.md)**: Type safety and interface design considerations
- **[Testing Conventions](testing-human.md)**: Testing patterns, parallel execution, and JPMS structure

Both language-specific guides build upon these foundational principles while addressing language-specific
concerns for code formatter development.
