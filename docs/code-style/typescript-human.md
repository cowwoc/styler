## üß† Why TypeScript for Code Formatters

TypeScript provides compile-time type safety that is crucial for code formatters because:
- **Parse accuracy**: Type checking prevents type mismatches (tokens vs nodes)
- **API contracts**: Interfaces ensure consistent data structures across parser modules
- **Refactoring safety**: Large-scale changes to AST models are safer with type checking
- **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation of parser data structures

## üö® TIER 1 CRITICAL - Build Blockers

### Export Organization - Scattered Throughout File
**Why consolidate exports**: In parser modules, scattered exports make it difficult to understand the public API. AST transformation modules should clearly show what functionality they expose.

**API clarity**: Consolidated exports at the end of the file provide a clear module interface, making it easier to understand dependencies between parser components.

**Maintenance benefit**: When language features change and modules need restructuring, consolidated exports make it easier to identify and update public interfaces.

### Import Organization - Incorrect Order
**Why order matters**: Consistent import ordering makes dependencies clear and prevents circular dependency issues common in parser systems.

**Mental model**: The import order reflects dependency layers:
1. JSON data (configuration, grammar definitions)
2. External libraries (parsing, AST utilities)
3. Internal modules (shared parser utilities)
4. Relative imports (local transformation helpers)

**Parser system clarity**: AST transformation modules often have complex dependencies. Clear import organization helps developers understand the data flow.

### Type Safety - Any Type Used
**Critical in parsers**: The `any` type defeats TypeScript's safety guarantees. In code parsing, losing type safety can lead to:
- Mixing token types (identifiers vs literals)
- Type confusion (expressions vs statements)
- Invalid state transitions in parser workflows

**Code quality impact**: Type errors in production can lead to incorrect code transformations, affecting source code integrity for users.

### Interface Naming - Generic Names
**Why descriptive names matter**: Parser systems have many data structures (AST nodes, token streams, parse contexts). Generic names create confusion and maintenance problems.

**Domain language**: Good interface names reflect parser domain concepts and make code self-documenting for developers who review transformation logic.

**Examples of good parser interface names**:
- `TokenDefinition` instead of `Data`
- `ParseOptions` instead of `Config`
- `TransformationState` instead of `State`

### JSDoc - Missing @throws Documentation
**Critical for parser functions**: AST parsing functions can fail in many ways (invalid syntax, language edge cases, parsing overflows). Proper documentation helps developers handle errors appropriately.

**Code quality requirement**: Parser applications often need detailed error handling for syntax validation and user experience. `@throws` documentation ensures proper error handling implementation.

### JSON Imports - Using Fetch for Static Data
**Why import over fetch**: Grammar configuration data (rules, precedence, operators) should be bundled with the application for performance and reliability. Fetch introduces runtime dependencies that can cause parsing failures.

**Build-time validation**: Importing JSON files allows TypeScript to validate the grammar structure at compile time, catching configuration errors before deployment.

### Optional Chaining - Incorrect Usage
**Parser data safety**: Code transformations often work with optional data (comments, metadata, etc.). Proper null handling prevents runtime errors in production parsing operations.

**Decision framework**:
- Use `?.` when data might legitimately be missing
- Use `!` only when you have business logic guarantees
- Never use `!` with user input or external API data

### Enum Usage - String Values Without Explicit Assignment
**Why explicit values**: Parser systems often integrate with external tools and databases. Explicit enum values ensure consistent serialization across system boundaries.

**Maintenance safety**: Auto-numbered enums can change values when new entries are added, breaking stored parser data or API contracts.

### Arrow Function Returns - Implicit Object Returns
**Common in parser transformations**: AST transformation code often transforms data structures. Implicit returns with objects can create subtle syntax errors that are hard to debug.

**Transformation pipeline clarity**: Explicit returns make AST data transformations more readable and maintainable.

### Promise Error Handling - Missing Catch
**Critical in parser systems**: Unhandled promise rejections can crash code transformation processes. Every async operation in parsing should have proper error handling.

**User experience**: Code formatters can't afford silent failures. Users need clear feedback when transformations fail.

### Interface Design - Missing Readonly Properties
**Why immutability matters**: Parser data like grammar rules and AST nodes should not be accidentally modified during transformations. `readonly` properties prevent unintended mutations.

**Functional programming benefits**: Immutable parser data structures make transformations more predictable and easier to test.

**Transformation trails**: Immutable data helps maintain proper audit trails for code transformations.

### Type Guards - Missing User-Defined Type Guards
**Parser data validation**: Code transformations often receive data from various sources (source files, APIs, databases). Custom type guards provide runtime validation with compile-time type safety.

**Error handling**: Good type guards provide meaningful error messages when parser data doesn't match expected types.

### Null Assertions - Unsafe Usage
**High risk in parsers**: Non-null assertions (`!`) are dangerous in parser code because they can cause runtime crashes during critical transformations.

**Safe alternatives**: Use optional chaining, type guards, or default values instead of assertions.

### Generic Constraints - Missing Constraints
**Type safety in transformations**: Parser functions should constrain their generic types to ensure only appropriate data structures are used in transformations.

**API design**: Well-constrained generics make parser utility functions safer and more self-documenting.

## üí° TIER 3 QUALITY - Best Practices

### Union Types - Using Any Instead of Union
**Better type modeling**: Parser data often has limited valid values (token types, node kinds, etc.). Union types model these constraints better than `any`.

**IntelliSense benefits**: Union types provide better autocomplete and error detection during development.

### Function Overloads - Missing Overload Signatures
**Complex parser operations**: AST transformation functions often behave differently based on input parameters. Function overloads provide better type safety than union parameter types.

**API usability**: Overloaded functions provide better development experience with more specific return types.

### Destructuring - Missing for Object Parameters
**Parser function clarity**: AST transformation functions often take many parameters. Destructuring makes function signatures clearer and reduces parameter-passing errors.

**Default values**: Destructuring enables easy default values for optional parser parameters.

### Utility Types - Not Using Built-in Utility Types
**Maintenance efficiency**: TypeScript's utility types reduce code duplication when creating variations of parser data interfaces.

**Type relationships**: Utility types express relationships between parser data types more clearly than manual interface definitions.

**Common parser patterns**:
- `Partial<ParseResult>` for incomplete parsing during analysis
- `Required<OptionalTokenFields>` for finalized transformations
- `Pick<SourceInfo, 'line' | 'column'>` for error-reporting data
