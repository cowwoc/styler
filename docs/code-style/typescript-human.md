## üß† Why TypeScript for Financial Systems

TypeScript provides compile-time type safety that is crucial for financial applications because:
- **Calculation accuracy**: Type checking prevents unit mismatches (dollars vs percentages)
- **API contracts**: Interfaces ensure consistent data structures across tax calculation modules
- **Refactoring safety**: Large-scale changes to financial models are safer with type checking
- **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation of financial data structures

## üö® TIER 1 CRITICAL - Build Blockers

### Export Organization - Scattered Throughout File
**Why consolidate exports**: In financial modules, scattered exports make it difficult to understand the public API. Tax calculation modules should clearly show what functionality they expose.

**API clarity**: Consolidated exports at the end of the file provide a clear module interface, making it easier to understand dependencies between financial calculation components.

**Maintenance benefit**: When tax rules change and modules need restructuring, consolidated exports make it easier to identify and update public interfaces.

### Import Organization - Incorrect Order
**Why order matters**: Consistent import ordering makes dependencies clear and prevents circular dependency issues common in financial calculation systems.

**Mental model**: The import order reflects dependency layers:
1. JSON data (configuration, tax tables)
2. External libraries (math, date handling)
3. Internal modules (shared financial utilities)
4. Relative imports (local calculation helpers)

**Financial system clarity**: Tax calculation modules often have complex dependencies. Clear import organization helps developers understand the data flow.

### Type Safety - Any Type Used
**Critical in finance**: The `any` type defeats TypeScript's safety guarantees. In financial calculations, losing type safety can lead to:
- Mixing currencies (CAD vs USD calculations)
- Unit confusion (annual vs monthly amounts)
- Invalid state transitions in financial workflows

**Business impact**: Type errors in production can lead to incorrect tax calculations, affecting real financial outcomes for users.

### Interface Naming - Generic Names
**Why descriptive names matter**: Financial systems have many data structures (tax brackets, contribution limits, pension calculations). Generic names create confusion and maintenance problems.

**Domain language**: Good interface names reflect financial domain concepts and make code self-documenting for business analysts who review tax calculation logic.

**Examples of good financial interface names**:
- `TaxBracketDefinition` instead of `Data`
- `ContributionLimits` instead of `Config`  
- `PensionCalculationState` instead of `State`

### JSDoc - Missing @throws Documentation
**Critical for financial functions**: Tax calculation functions can fail in many ways (invalid inputs, regulatory edge cases, calculation overflows). Proper documentation helps developers handle errors appropriately.

**Business requirement**: Financial applications often need detailed error handling for compliance and user experience. `@throws` documentation ensures proper error handling implementation.

### JSON Imports - Using Fetch for Static Data
**Why import over fetch**: Tax configuration data (rates, brackets, limits) should be bundled with the application for performance and reliability. Fetch introduces runtime dependencies that can cause calculation failures.

**Build-time validation**: Importing JSON files allows TypeScript to validate the data structure at compile time, catching configuration errors before deployment.

### Optional Chaining - Incorrect Usage
**Financial data safety**: Tax calculations often work with optional data (spouse information, business income, etc.). Proper null handling prevents runtime errors in production financial calculations.

**Decision framework**:
- Use `?.` when data might legitimately be missing
- Use `!` only when you have business logic guarantees
- Never use `!` with user input or external API data

### Enum Usage - String Values Without Explicit Assignment
**Why explicit values**: Financial systems often integrate with external APIs and databases. Explicit enum values ensure consistent serialization across system boundaries.

**Maintenance safety**: Auto-numbered enums can change values when new entries are added, breaking stored financial data or API contracts.

### Arrow Function Returns - Implicit Object Returns
**Common in financial transformations**: Tax calculation code often transforms data structures. Implicit returns with objects can create subtle syntax errors that are hard to debug.

**Calculation pipeline clarity**: Explicit returns make financial data transformations more readable and maintainable.

### Promise Error Handling - Missing Catch
**Critical in financial systems**: Unhandled promise rejections can crash financial calculation processes. Every async operation in tax calculations should have proper error handling.

**User experience**: Financial applications can't afford silent failures. Users need clear feedback when calculations fail.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TIER 2 IMPORTANT - Code Review

### Interface Design - Missing Readonly Properties
**Why immutability matters**: Financial data like tax rates and contribution limits should not be accidentally modified during calculations. `readonly` properties prevent unintended mutations.

**Functional programming benefits**: Immutable financial data structures make calculations more predictable and easier to test.

**Audit trails**: Immutable data helps maintain proper audit trails for financial calculations.

### Type Guards - Missing User-Defined Type Guards
**Financial data validation**: Tax calculations often receive data from various sources (user input, APIs, databases). Custom type guards provide runtime validation with compile-time type safety.

**Error handling**: Good type guards provide meaningful error messages when financial data doesn't match expected types.

### Null Assertions - Unsafe Usage
**High risk in finance**: Non-null assertions (`!`) are dangerous in financial code because they can cause runtime crashes during critical calculations.

**Safe alternatives**: Use optional chaining, type guards, or default values instead of assertions.

### Generic Constraints - Missing Constraints
**Type safety in calculations**: Financial functions should constrain their generic types to ensure only appropriate data structures are used in calculations.

**API design**: Well-constrained generics make financial utility functions safer and more self-documenting.

## üí° TIER 3 QUALITY - Best Practices

### Union Types - Using Any Instead of Union
**Better type modeling**: Financial data often has limited valid values (tax filing status, contribution types, etc.). Union types model these constraints better than `any`.

**IntelliSense benefits**: Union types provide better autocomplete and error detection during development.

### Function Overloads - Missing Overload Signatures
**Complex financial calculations**: Tax calculation functions often behave differently based on input parameters. Function overloads provide better type safety than union parameter types.

**API usability**: Overloaded functions provide better development experience with more specific return types.

### Destructuring - Missing for Object Parameters
**Financial function clarity**: Tax calculation functions often take many parameters. Destructuring makes function signatures clearer and reduces parameter-passing errors.

**Default values**: Destructuring enables easy default values for optional financial parameters.

### Utility Types - Not Using Built-in Utility Types
**Maintenance efficiency**: TypeScript's utility types reduce code duplication when creating variations of financial data interfaces.

**Type relationships**: Utility types express relationships between financial data types more clearly than manual interface definitions.

**Common financial patterns**:
- `Partial<TaxReturn>` for incomplete tax data during preparation
- `Required<OptionalIncomeFields>` for finalized calculations
- `Pick<PersonalInfo, 'age' | 'province'>` for calculation-specific data
