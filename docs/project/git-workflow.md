# Git Workflow Guidelines

This document outlines git workflows and best practices for the Betty project.

## Commit Squashing Procedures

### Overview

When you need to combine (squash) commits in your git history, there are two main approaches:

1. **Interactive Rebase** (PRIMARY METHOD) - Reliable, efficient, and handles complex scenarios
2. **Cherry-pick Method** - Advanced manual approach for exceptional cases only

**ALWAYS use Interactive Rebase unless specifically required otherwise.** Both workflows support squashing non-adjacent commits while preserving intermediate commits, useful for consolidating related functionality without losing unrelated work.

## Interactive Rebase (PRIMARY METHOD)

**RECOMMENDED APPROACH**: Use interactive rebase for all squash operations unless specific circumstances require the cherry-pick fallback method.

### Interactive Rebase Procedure

#### 1. Create Backup Branch

Always create a backup branch before performing any git history operations:

```bash
git checkout -b backup-before-squash-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git checkout main  # or your working branch
```

#### 2. Create Chronological Rebase Plan

**CRITICAL**: Before starting rebase, create and validate the chronological plan to prevent commit reordering.

**Step 2a: Document Original Commit Order**
```bash
# Document the EXACT original chronological order
git log --oneline <base-commit>..HEAD > original-commit-order.txt
cat original-commit-order.txt
```

**Step 2b: Create Preservation Plan**
Identify which commits to preserve in their exact original positions:
```bash
# Example: If squashing commits 098c953, 709c52a, 31efd60, 1311b64, d4ca920, d1edc60
# And preserving 0ed377d, f40ab63, c29c828, d345c52, c2b4a7e (in that order)

echo "SQUASH TARGETS: 098c953, 709c52a, 31efd60, 1311b64, d4ca920, d1edc60" > rebase-plan.txt
echo "PRESERVE ORDER: 0ed377d, f40ab63, c29c828, d345c52, c2b4a7e" >> rebase-plan.txt
echo "PRESERVE AFTER: [list all commits after the newest target]" >> rebase-plan.txt
```

**Step 2c: Validate Chronological Consistency**
```bash
# MANDATORY: Verify no chronological violations in your plan
# Check that preserved commits maintain their relative order
git log --oneline --grep="0ed377d\|f40ab63\|c29c828\|d345c52\|c2b4a7e" <base-commit>..HEAD
```

**Step 2d: Start Interactive Rebase**
```bash
git rebase -i <base-commit>  # e.g., git rebase -i eee773804f
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENT SAFEGUARDS**

Interactive rebase requires manual editor intervention. In automated environments (CLI tools, scripts), implement these safeguards:

**Safeguard 1: Verify Editor Interaction**
```bash
# Before starting rebase, verify git editor is configured
git config --get core.editor
# If empty or problematic, set explicit editor:
export GIT_EDITOR="nano"  # or vim, emacs, etc.
```

**Safeguard 2: Never Use Destructive Fallbacks**
```bash
# ‚ùå PROHIBITED: If interactive rebase seems to "fail" (auto-closes, no changes):
# git reset --soft <commit>   # CATASTROPHIC - eliminates timeline segments

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: If interactive rebase doesn't work:
# 1. Abort the rebase safely
git rebase --abort
# 2. Investigate the editor/environment issue
# 3. Fix the root cause, then retry
# 4. If unsolvable, seek manual intervention - NEVER use destructive methods
```

**Safeguard 3: Validate Rebase Completion**
```bash
# After rebase completes, immediately verify all expected commits remain:
git log --oneline -20 > post-rebase-order.txt
# Compare against original-commit-order.txt to detect lost commits
diff -u original-commit-order.txt post-rebase-order.txt
```

**Base Commit Selection**:
- Use the commit BEFORE the oldest commit you want to modify
- For example, to squash commits A, B, C, use the parent of A as base-commit
- Use `git log --oneline -20` to identify the correct base commit

#### 3. Configure Squash Operations with Chronological Validation

**üö® CRITICAL CHRONOLOGICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT:**
Git presents commits in chronological order (oldest first), and you MUST preserve this order for non-squashed commits to prevent historical reordering.

**Step 3a: Review Git's Default Plan**
Git will present commits in chronological order:
```
pick eee7738 Restructure todo.md with proper architecture
pick 098c953 Add empirical data requirement for analysis tasks
pick 0ed377d Complete study-claude-cli-help empirical analysis  
pick f40ab63 Complete study-claude-core-tools comprehensive analysis
pick c29c828 Mark study-claude-startup-errors as completed
pick 709c52a Enhance task protocol with scope negotiation
pick d345c52 Complete study-claude-session-basics analysis task
pick c2b4a7e Add custom code style rules and enhance checkstyle rules
pick 31efd60 Enhance task protocol to enforce empirical validation
```

**Step 3b: Apply Squash Commands WITHOUT Reordering**
Mark targets for squashing while preserving chronological sequence:
```
pick eee7738 Restructure todo.md with proper architecture
squash 098c953 Add empirical data requirement for analysis tasks
pick 0ed377d Complete study-claude-cli-help empirical analysis  
pick f40ab63 Complete study-claude-core-tools comprehensive analysis
pick c29c828 Mark study-claude-startup-errors as completed
squash 709c52a Enhance task protocol with scope negotiation
pick d345c52 Complete study-claude-session-basics analysis task
pick c2b4a7e Add custom code style rules and enhance checkstyle rules
squash 31efd60 Enhance task protocol to enforce empirical validation
```

**üö® MANDATORY CHRONOLOGICAL VALIDATION:**
Before saving the rebase plan, verify:
1. **Non-squashed commits appear in SAME ORDER as original history**
2. **No preserved commits have been moved relative to each other**  
3. **Only squash/fixup commands applied to target commits**

**Key Commands**:
- `pick`: Keep commit as-is (default for all commits)
- `squash` (or `s`): Combine with previous picked commit, keep both commit messages
- `fixup` (or `f`): Combine with previous picked commit, discard this commit's message
- `drop` (or `d`): Remove commit entirely from history
- `reword` (or `r`): Keep commit but edit the commit message
- `edit` (or `e`): Pause rebase to make changes to this commit

**CRITICAL SQUASHING RULES**:
1. **Cannot squash the first commit** - it needs a target to squash into
2. **Squash/fixup always targets the previous picked commit** in the list
3. **Order matters** - commits are applied top-to-bottom (chronologically)
4. **üö® NEW: NEVER reorder preserved commits** - maintain exact original sequence

#### 4. Handle Conflicts During Rebase

**When conflicts occur**, git will pause the rebase and display conflict information:

```bash
# Git will show something like:
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in docs/file.md
error: could not apply abc1234... commit message
Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
```

**Systematic Conflict Resolution Process**:

1. **Identify conflicted files**:
   ```bash
   git status  # Shows files with conflicts
   ```

2. **Analyze each conflict**:
   ```bash
   # Open conflicted file in editor
   # Look for conflict markers:
   # <<<<<<< HEAD (current state)
   # content from target commit
   # =======
   # content from commit being applied  
   # >>>>>>> abc1234 (commit being applied)
   ```

3. **Apply conflict resolution strategy** (see below)

4. **Mark conflict as resolved**:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-file>  # Stage the resolved file
   ```

5. **Continue rebase**:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

#### 5. Advanced Conflict Resolution Strategies

**Strategy 1: State Tracking Conflicts** (todo.md, documentation status, etc.)

```bash
# Common pattern: Task completion status conflicts
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# - [ ] incomplete task
# =======  
# - [x] completed task
# >>>>>>> commit-hash

# RESOLUTION STRATEGY: Choose the more advanced state
# If work was actually completed, choose [x]
# If work was reverted, choose [ ]
# Principle: Preserve actual work progress
```

**Strategy 2: Code Logic Conflicts**

```bash
# RESOLUTION STRATEGY: Analyze both implementations
# 1. Understand what each change accomplishes
# 2. Determine if changes are:
#    - Competing (choose one)
#    - Complementary (merge both)
#    - Sequential (apply in logical order)
# 3. Test the merged result if possible

# Example approach:
git show HEAD -- conflicted-file.java        # See current version
git show <commit-hash> -- conflicted-file.java  # See incoming version
# Make informed decision based on code analysis
```

**Strategy 3: Documentation and Configuration Conflicts**

```bash
# RESOLUTION STRATEGY: Preserve comprehensive information
# 1. Generally prefer the more complete/detailed version
# 2. Merge improvements from both sides when possible
# 3. Maintain consistency with project conventions
# 4. Ensure all referenced files/sections still exist
```

**Strategy 4: Dependency and Build Configuration Conflicts**

```bash
# RESOLUTION STRATEGY: Maintain build integrity
# 1. Choose version that maintains successful builds
# 2. If both versions build, prefer newer dependencies
# 3. Check for compatibility between conflicted components
# 4. Test build after resolution: mvn clean install
```

#### 6. Advanced Conflict Handling Scenarios

**Scenario A: Multiple Files with Related Conflicts**

When conflicts span multiple related files, resolve them as a group:

```bash
# Resolve all related files before continuing
git add file1.java file2.java config.xml
git rebase --continue
```

**Scenario B: Complex Three-Way Conflicts**

When squashing creates conflicts that involve multiple commits:

```bash
# Use git mergetool for complex conflicts
git mergetool
# or examine the full conflict history
git log --merge --oneline -p <conflicted-file>
```

**Scenario C: Conflicting Commit Messages During Squash**

When squashing commits, git will prompt for the combined commit message:

```bash
# Git opens editor with both messages:
# This is a combination of 2 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
# Original commit message 1
# 
# This is the 2nd commit message:
# Original commit message 2

# EDIT TO CREATE: Single coherent commit message
# Combine functionality descriptions
# Remove redundant information
# Follow project commit message conventions
```

#### 7. Error Recovery During Rebase

**If conflicts become too complex or you make mistakes:**

```bash
# ABORT entire rebase and return to original state
git rebase --abort

# Return to backup branch if needed
git reset --hard backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

**If you accidentally continue with unresolved conflicts:**

```bash
# Check if build/tests still work
mvn clean install

# If problems exist, reset to backup and restart
git reset --hard backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

**If you need to skip a problematic commit:**

```bash
# Skip current commit (use carefully - causes data loss)
git rebase --skip

# Better alternative: edit the rebase plan
# 1. git rebase --abort  
# 2. git rebase -i <base-commit>
# 3. Change 'pick' to 'drop' for problematic commit
```

#### 8. Verify Results with Chronological Validation

After successful rebase, perform comprehensive verification:

**Step 8a: Commit History Verification**
```bash
git log --oneline -15                    # Check commit history
git log --stat -5                        # Review file changes
```

**Step 8b: üö® MANDATORY Chronological Order Validation**
```bash
# Compare preserved commit order against original
git log --oneline backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS > original-order.txt
git log --oneline HEAD > new-order.txt

# CRITICAL: Verify non-squashed commits maintain relative order
echo "=== CHRONOLOGICAL VALIDATION ==="
echo "Check that preserved commits appear in same relative order:"
diff -u original-order.txt new-order.txt
```

**Step 8c: Content and Build Verification**
```bash
git diff backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS  # Verify changes are correct  
mvn clean install                        # Verify build integrity
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Commit count reduced by number of squashed commits
- ‚úÖ All functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ Build and tests pass
- ‚úÖ Commit messages are coherent and informative
- ‚úÖ **üö® NEW: Preserved commits maintain chronological order**

**üö® FAILURE CRITERIA - Abort and Restart if:**
- Preserved commits appear in different relative order than original
- Any non-target commits have been accidentally moved
- Chronological sequence has been disrupted

**Recovery from Chronological Violations:**
```bash
# If chronological order violated, abort and restart
git reset --hard backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
echo "CHRONOLOGICAL VIOLATION DETECTED - Restarting with corrected plan"
# Return to Step 2 and create proper chronological plan
```

#### 9. Error Recovery and Critical Failure Analysis

**üö® CRITICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK**

**Never Blame the Tool for Execution Failures**

Common pattern of incorrect failure attribution:
1. Interactive rebase "fails" (usually due to environment/editor issues)  
2. User incorrectly concludes "interactive rebase doesn't work"
3. User switches to alternative methods (reset, cherry-pick)
4. Alternative methods cause data loss or chronological violations
5. **Root cause was execution environment, not the rebase method**

**Correct Response to Interactive Rebase Issues:**
```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG: "Interactive rebase failed, let me try git reset instead"
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Interactive rebase didn't complete, let me fix the editor/environment issue"

# Debug steps:
git config --get core.editor
echo $EDITOR
git rebase --abort  # Reset to clean state
# Fix editor configuration, then retry with same method
```

**Emergency Abort and Recovery**
```bash
# ABORT entire rebase and return to original state
git rebase --abort
# Return to backup branch if needed
git reset --hard backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

#### 10. Finalization

If results are satisfactory:

```bash
# Optional: Update commit messages if needed
git commit --amend  # for most recent commit only

# The rebase is complete - no branch switching needed
# Original branch now contains the squashed history
```

#### 10. Cleanup Backup Branch

Only after confirming everything works correctly:

```bash
git branch -D backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

### Critical Success Factors for Complex Squash Operations

**üö® MANDATORY CHRONOLOGICAL PRESERVATION PROTOCOL:**
1. **Pre-rebase Planning**: Document original commit order before starting
2. **Rebase Plan Validation**: Verify preserved commits maintain sequence  
3. **Post-rebase Verification**: Systematically validate chronological integrity
4. **Failure Recovery**: Immediate rollback if chronological violations detected

**Common Failure Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Applying squash commands without verifying preserved commit order
- ‚ùå Assuming git automatically maintains chronological sequence
- ‚ùå Skipping post-rebase chronological validation
- ‚ùå Accepting chronological violations as "acceptable side effects"

**Why Chronological Preservation Matters:**
- **Historical Accuracy**: Maintains true development timeline
- **Debugging Context**: Preserves problem-solving sequence for future reference
- **Code Review**: Ensures logical development progression remains intact
- **Blame Analysis**: Maintains accurate attribution timeline

### Handling Non-Contiguous Commits

**CRITICAL DECISION POINT**: When commits to be squashed are not adjacent in git history, you must choose the appropriate strategy based on your specific situation.

#### Decision Matrix for Non-Contiguous Commits

**Scenario A: Historical Reorganization** (commits already exist, not adjacent)
- **User Request Pattern**: "Squash commits A, B, C into commit D" where commits are scattered
- **Required Approach**: Interactive rebase with careful reordering
- **Safety Requirements**: Must preserve intermediate unrelated commits

**Scenario B: Future Development Workflow** (adding fixes to existing commits)  
- **User Request Pattern**: "Fix this issue in commit X" where X is several commits back
- **Preferred Approach**: Fixup commits + autosquash
- **Benefits**: Maintains timeline until final squashing

#### Strategy 1: Interactive Rebase for Non-Contiguous Historical Commits

**When to Use**: Historical reorganization of existing commits that are not adjacent

**MANDATORY SAFETY PROTOCOL**:
```bash
# 1. Document ALL commits in the range to prevent data loss
git log --oneline <oldest-target>^..HEAD > commit-inventory.txt

# 2. Identify EXACTLY which commits to squash vs. preserve
echo "SQUASH TARGETS:" > rebase-plan-detailed.txt
echo "- eb6925d Refactor JavadocParameterAlignment" >> rebase-plan-detailed.txt
echo "- e6477b0 Add checkstyle tests" >> rebase-plan-detailed.txt
echo "- 95375a5 Apply code formatting updates" >> rebase-plan-detailed.txt
echo "" >> rebase-plan-detailed.txt
echo "PRESERVE (maintain exact order):" >> rebase-plan-detailed.txt
echo "- f3824d3 Complete study-claude-streaming-behavior" >> rebase-plan-detailed.txt
echo "- d7fbd9a Complete study-claude-tool-orchestration" >> rebase-plan-detailed.txt

# 3. Start interactive rebase with careful reordering
git rebase -i <base-commit>
```

**CRITICAL REORDERING PROCEDURE**:
1. **Move related commits together** in the interactive rebase editor
2. **Preserve chronological order** for all non-target commits
3. **Apply squash commands** only after grouping related commits

**Example Interactive Rebase Plan**:
```
# Original git presents (chronologically oldest to newest):
pick f888a4c Add custom code style rules
pick 95375a5 Apply code formatting updates          # TARGET 1
pick f3824d3 Complete study-claude-streaming        # PRESERVE - keep position
pick e6477b0 Add checkstyle tests                   # TARGET 2  
pick eb6925d Refactor JavadocParameterAlignment     # TARGET 3

# MODIFY TO (group targets together, preserve others):
pick f888a4c Add custom code style rules
squash 95375a5 Apply code formatting updates        # Move and squash into f888a4c
squash e6477b0 Add checkstyle tests                 # Move and squash into f888a4c
squash eb6925d Refactor JavadocParameterAlignment   # Move and squash into f888a4c  
pick f3824d3 Complete study-claude-streaming        # Preserve original position
```

**VIOLATION PREVENTION**:
- ‚ùå **Never reorder preserved commits** relative to each other
- ‚ùå **Never drop commits** that weren't in the squash request  
- ‚úÖ **Only reorder commits that are being squashed together**
- ‚úÖ **Maintain all other commits in their original positions**

#### Strategy 2: Fixup Workflow for Future Development

**When to Use**: When you need to make fixes to older commits during active development

**Procedure**:
```bash
# 1. Create fixup commit targeting specific older commit
git add <files-to-fix>
git commit --fixup <target-commit-hash>

# 2. Continue development normally (creates timeline preservation)
git commit -m "New feature work"  
git commit -m "More development" 

# 3. Later, squash fixups automatically when ready
git rebase -i --autosquash <base-commit>
```

**Advantages of Fixup Approach**:
- Preserves development timeline until final squash
- Clear intent marking (fixup! commits are obvious)  
- Atomic safety (each step is a working commit)
- Git handles the arrangement logic automatically

**Fixup Limitations**:
- Only works for amendments to existing commits
- Cannot reorganize completely unrelated commits
- Still requires interactive rebase for final application

#### Critical Success Factors for Non-Contiguous Squashing

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION AFTER REORDERING**:
```bash
# 1. Verify ALL expected commits are present
git log --oneline -20 > post-rebase-commits.txt
wc -l post-rebase-commits.txt  # Should be original count minus squashed count

# 2. Verify preserved commits maintain their relative order
# Check that non-squashed commits appear in same sequence as original

# 3. Content verification
git diff backup-branch..HEAD --stat  # Should show only intended changes
```

**EMERGENCY RECOVERY**:
```bash
# If commit order is violated or commits are dropped:
git rebase --abort
git reset --hard backup-branch
echo "REORDER VIOLATION - Restarting with corrected plan"
```

### When Interactive Rebase May Not Be Suitable

**Use Cherry-pick Method Instead When**:
- Working with commits from different branches/remotes
- Need very fine-grained control over individual commit application  
- Interactive rebase repeatedly fails due to complex conflicts (>50 commits with extensive conflicts)
- Working with a corrupted or unusual git history structure

**Note on Chronological Preservation**: Interactive rebase is fully capable of maintaining chronological order in all scenarios when proper planning and verification procedures are followed. The complexity lies in human planning, not in git's technical capabilities.

## Cherry-pick Method (Advanced/Fallback Approach)

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: This is a complex manual approach. Use Interactive Rebase (see above) for most cases.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: User Request Validation

**BEFORE STARTING**: Parse the user's squash request EXACTLY to avoid data loss.

**USER REQUEST PATTERN**: "Squash commits A, B, C, D, E, F into commit G"

**MANDATORY VALIDATION**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify each requested commit hash exists: `git show A`, `git show B`, etc.
2. ‚úÖ Identify the BASE commit G (target for squashing)
3. ‚úÖ Identify ALL commits between base G and HEAD that are NOT in the user's list
4. ‚úÖ These non-listed commits MUST be preserved exactly as they are

**COMMON ERROR**: Assuming "squash into G" means "squash everything from G to HEAD"
**CORRECT INTERPRETATION**: "squash ONLY the specified commits A,B,C,D,E,F into G"

### Procedure

#### 1. Create Backup Branch

Always create a backup branch before performing complex git operations:

```bash
git checkout -b backup-before-squash-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
git checkout main  # or your working branch
```

#### 2. Analyze Commit Structure and Validate User Request

**üö® CRITICAL**: Parse the user's EXACT request to identify specific commits to squash:

```bash
# If user specifies: "Squash d1edc60f7, d4ca9202a, 1311b64bf, 31efd60a1, 709c52ab1, 098c95394 into eee773804f"
# MANDATORY: Validate each commit hash exists and identify the EXACT range
git show --oneline d1edc60f7  # Must exist and be target commit
git show --oneline 098c95394  # Must exist and be target commit  
git show --oneline eee773804f # Must exist and be base commit
```

**üö® COMMIT RANGE VALIDATION**: Identify ALL commits in the range - those to be squashed, intermediate commits, AND commits after the targets:

```bash
git log --oneline -25  # Use broader range to see all affected commits
# MANUALLY verify each commit in the user's request exists in this list
```

Example structure:
```
xyz4567 (commit AFTER targets - MUST PRESERVE)
wvu8901 (commit AFTER targets - MUST PRESERVE)
abc1234 (commit AFTER targets - MUST PRESERVE)
def5678 (commit to squash - newer TARGET)
ghi9012 (intermediate commit to preserve)  
jkl3456 (intermediate commit to preserve)
mno7890 (commit to squash - older TARGET)
pqr1234 (base commit)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ERROR TO AVOID**: Forgetting commits that come AFTER the target commits will result in permanent data loss.

#### 3. Create Working Branch

Create a new branch with "squashed" in the name for the squash operation:

```bash
git checkout -b main-squashed  # Keep original branch name + "squashed"
# or for feature branches: git checkout -b feature-name-squashed
```

**CRITICAL**: The original branch keeps its name, the new branch gets "squashed" suffix.

#### 4. Perform Targeted Soft Reset

**üö® CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION**: Only reset to capture the EXACT commits requested for squashing:

```bash
# WRONG: git reset --soft base-commit  # This captures ALL commits from base to HEAD
# RIGHT: Use interactive rebase or cherry-pick approach for non-adjacent commits

# For user request "Squash A, B, C into D":
# Step 1: Create new branch from base commit D
git checkout -b temp-squash D

# Step 2: Cherry-pick each target commit to create combined diff
git cherry-pick --no-commit A
git cherry-pick --no-commit B  
git cherry-pick --no-commit C
# Now staging area contains ONLY the changes from A, B, C
```

**ALTERNATIVE SAFE APPROACH** for non-adjacent commits:
```bash
# Reset to base, then apply only target commits
git reset --soft D  # base commit specified by user
# DANGER: This stages ALL commits from D to HEAD
# MUST manually exclude non-target commits (see next section)
```

#### 5. Handle Staging Area for Exact Target Commits

**üö® IF USING SOFT RESET APPROACH**: Remove changes from non-target commits before committing:

```bash
# After git reset --soft base-commit, staging area contains ALL commits from base to HEAD
# MUST unstage files that belong to non-target commits

# Identify files changed by non-target commits:
git diff --name-only intermediate-commit-1^..intermediate-commit-1
git diff --name-only commit-after-target-1^..commit-after-target-1

# Unstage those files and restore them to their non-target commit state:
git restore --staged path/to/file/from/non-target-commit
git restore --source=intermediate-commit-1 path/to/file/from/non-target-commit

# WARNING: This approach is error-prone. Cherry-pick method (step 4) is safer.
```

#### 6. Create Squashed Commit

Create a new commit that combines the functionality of ONLY the target commits:

```bash
git commit -m "Combined functionality: descriptive message

- Feature from commit mno7890
- Enhancement from commit def5678
- Additional changes from intermediate commits
- Comprehensive description of combined functionality

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

#### 7. Restore ALL Non-Target Commits  

**üö® CRITICAL**: Cherry-pick ALL commits that were NOT in the user's squash request, in chronological order:

```bash
# Cherry-pick intermediate commits first (between targets)
git cherry-pick jkl3456  # intermediate commit 1 (older)
git cherry-pick ghi9012  # intermediate commit 2 (newer)

# Cherry-pick ALL commits that came AFTER the target commits
git cherry-pick abc1234  # commit after targets 1
git cherry-pick wvu8901  # commit after targets 2  
git cherry-pick xyz4567  # commit after targets 3
# Continue for ALL commits that came after the newest target
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY**: Every commit that existed in the original history (except the two being squashed) MUST be preserved.

#### 8. Verify Result

Check the final commit structure:

```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

Expected result:
```
xyz4567 (commit after targets 3 - cherry-picked)
wvu8901 (commit after targets 2 - cherry-picked)
abc1234 (commit after targets 1 - cherry-picked)
ghi9012 (intermediate commit 2 - cherry-picked)
jkl3456 (intermediate commit 1 - cherry-picked)  
stu1098 (squashed commit with combined functionality)
pqr1234 (base commit)
```

**‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA**: The new history contains the same number of commits as the original, minus one (because two commits were squashed into one).

#### 9. Test Build Integrity

Verify that the changes work correctly:

```bash
mvn clean install
# Run relevant tests
```

#### 10. User Approval

Present the results to the user and get approval for the changes.

#### 11. Replace Original Branch (if approved)

If the user approves the result, replace the original branch:

```bash
git checkout main  # switch to original branch
git reset --hard main-squashed  # replace with squashed version
git branch -D main-squashed  # delete the squashed branch
```

**WORKFLOW**: Original branch is replaced, squashed branch is deleted and renamed to original name.

#### 12. Cleanup Backup Branch (if approved)

Remove the backup branch only after user confirmation:

```bash
git branch -D backup-before-squash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

**NOTE**: Only delete backup branch after confirming squashed branch works correctly.

### Important Notes

- **Always create backups** before complex git operations
- **Test build integrity** after any history rewriting
- **Get user approval** before removing backup branches
- **Preserve commit messages** that provide valuable context
- **Maintain logical commit grouping** when possible

### üö® CRITICAL DATA LOSS PREVENTION

**MOST COMMON ERROR**: Dropping commits that come AFTER the target commits.

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST** before declaring squash complete:
1. ‚úÖ Count commits in original: `git rev-list --count backup-branch`
2. ‚úÖ Count commits in new branch: `git rev-list --count new-branch`  
3. ‚úÖ Verify: new count = original count - 1 (exactly one less due to squashing)
4. ‚úÖ If counts don't match: **STOP** and identify missing commits

**RECOVERY WHEN COMMITS ARE DROPPED**:
```bash
# Compare what was lost
git log --oneline backup-branch --not new-branch

# Cherry-pick each missing commit
git cherry-pick <missing-commit-hash>
```

### When to Use This Procedure

Use this squashing procedure when:
- Combining related functionality scattered across the commit history
- Consolidating rule development or feature work
- Creating cleaner release branches
- Preparing commits for code review

### When NOT to Use

Avoid this procedure when:
- Simple adjacent commit squashing is sufficient
- The intermediate commits are closely related to the squashed commits
- The commit history is complex with many merge commits
- Working on shared branches with multiple contributors

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Git history rewriting is a destructive operation. Always ensure you have backups and user approval before proceeding with complex squash operations.
