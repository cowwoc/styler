# Task State Machine Protocol

**CRITICAL**: This protocol applies to ALL tasks that create, modify, or delete files, using MANDATORY STATE TRANSITIONS with zero-tolerance enforcement

**TARGET AUDIENCE**: Claude AI instances executing tasks
**ARCHITECTURE**: State machine with atomic transitions and verifiable conditions
**ENFORCEMENT**: No manual overrides - all transitions require documented evidence

## STATE MACHINE ARCHITECTURE

### Core States
```
INIT → CLASSIFIED → REQUIREMENTS → SYNTHESIS → IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATION → REVIEW → COMPLETE → CLEANUP
                                      ↑                                      ↓
                                      └─────── SCOPE_NEGOTIATION ←──────────┘
```

### State Definitions
- **INIT**: Task selected, locks acquired, session validated
- **CLASSIFIED**: Risk level determined, agents selected, isolation established
- **REQUIREMENTS**: All stakeholder requirements collected and validated
- **SYNTHESIS**: Requirements consolidated into unified architecture plan
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: Code and tests created according to synthesis plan
- **VALIDATION**: Build verification and automated quality gates passed
- **REVIEW**: All stakeholder agents provide unanimous approval
- **SCOPE_NEGOTIATION**: Determine what work can be deferred when agents reject due to scope concerns
- **COMPLETE**: Work preserved to main branch, todo.md updated
- **CLEANUP**: Worktrees removed, locks released, temporary files cleaned

### State Transitions
Each transition requires **ALL** specified conditions to be met. **NO EXCEPTIONS.**

## RISK-BASED AGENT SELECTION ENGINE

### Automatic Risk Classification
**Input**: File paths from modification request
**Process**: Pattern matching → Escalation trigger analysis → Agent set determination
**Output**: Risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) + Required agent set

### HIGH-RISK FILES (Complete Validation Required)
**Patterns:**
- `src/**/*.java` (core implementation)
- `pom.xml`, `**/pom.xml` (build configuration)
- `.github/**` (CI/CD workflows)
- `**/security/**` (security components)
- `checkstyle.xml`, `**/checkstyle*.xml` (style enforcement)
- `CLAUDE.md` (critical configuration)
- `docs/project/task-protocol.md` (protocol configuration)
- `docs/project/critical-rules.md` (safety rules)

**Required Agents**: technical-architect, style-auditor, code-quality-auditor, build-validator
**Additional Agents**: security-auditor (if security-related), performance-analyzer (if performance-critical), code-tester (if new functionality), usability-reviewer (if user-facing)

### MEDIUM-RISK FILES (Domain Validation Required)
**Patterns:**
- `src/test/**/*.java` (test files)
- `docs/code-style/**` (style documentation)
- `**/resources/**/*.properties` (configuration)
- `**/*Test.java`, `**/*Tests.java` (test classes)

**Required Agents**: technical-architect, code-quality-auditor
**Additional Agents**: style-auditor (if style files), security-auditor (if config files), performance-analyzer (if benchmarks)

### LOW-RISK FILES (Minimal Validation Required)
**Patterns:**
- `*.md` (except CLAUDE.md, task-protocol.md, critical-rules.md)
- `docs/**/*.md` (general documentation)
- `todo.md` (task tracking)
- `*.txt`, `*.log` (text files)
- `**/README*` (readme files)

**Required Agents**: None (unless escalation triggered)

### Escalation Triggers
**Keywords**: "security", "architecture", "breaking", "performance", "concurrent", "database", "api", "state", "dependency"
**Content Analysis**: Cross-module dependencies, security implications, architectural changes
**Action**: Force escalation to next higher risk level

### Manual Overrides
**Force Full Protocol**: `--force-full-protocol` flag for critical changes
**Explicit Risk Level**: `--risk-level=HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW` to override classification
**Escalation Keywords**: "security", "architecture", "breaking" in task description

### Risk Assessment Audit Trail
**Required Logging:**
- Risk level selected (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Classification method (pattern match, keyword trigger, manual override)
- Escalation triggers activated (if any)
- Workflow variant executed (FULL/ABBREVIATED/STREAMLINED)
- Agent set selected for review
- Final outcome (approved/rejected/deferred)

**Implementation**: Log in state.json file and commit messages for audit purposes

## WORKFLOW VARIANTS BY RISK LEVEL

### HIGH_RISK_WORKFLOW (Complete Validation)
**States Executed**: INIT → CLASSIFIED → REQUIREMENTS → SYNTHESIS → IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATION → REVIEW → COMPLETE → CLEANUP
**Stakeholder Agents**: All agents based on task requirements
**Isolation**: Mandatory worktree isolation
**Review**: Complete stakeholder validation
**Use Case**: Core implementation, build configuration, security, CI/CD
**Conditional Skips**: None - all validation required

### MEDIUM_RISK_WORKFLOW (Domain Validation)
**States Executed**: INIT → CLASSIFIED → REQUIREMENTS → SYNTHESIS → IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATION → REVIEW → COMPLETE → CLEANUP
**Stakeholder Agents**: Based on change characteristics
- Base: technical-architect (always required)
- +style-auditor: If style/formatting files modified
- +security-auditor: If any configuration or resource files modified
- +performance-analyzer: If test performance or benchmarks affected
- +code-quality-auditor: Always included for code quality validation
**Isolation**: Worktree isolation for multi-file changes
**Review**: Domain-appropriate stakeholder validation
**Use Case**: Test files, style documentation, configuration files
**Conditional Skips**: May skip IMPLEMENTATION/VALIDATION states if only documentation changes

### LOW_RISK_WORKFLOW (Streamlined Validation)
**States Executed**: INIT → CLASSIFIED → REQUIREMENTS → SYNTHESIS → COMPLETE → CLEANUP
**Stakeholder Agents**: None (unless escalation triggered)
**Isolation**: Required for multi-file changes, optional for single documentation file
**Review**: Evidence-based validation and automated checks
**Safety Gates**:
- Verify no cross-references to modified files in src/
- Confirm no build configuration impact
- Validate no security-sensitive content changes
**Use Case**: Documentation updates, todo.md, README files
**Conditional Skips**: Skip IMPLEMENTATION, VALIDATION, REVIEW states entirely

### Conditional State Transition Logic
```python
def determine_state_path(risk_level, change_type):
    """Determine which states to execute based on risk and change type"""

    base_states = ["INIT", "CLASSIFIED", "REQUIREMENTS", "SYNTHESIS"]

    if risk_level == "HIGH":
        return base_states + ["IMPLEMENTATION", "VALIDATION", "REVIEW", "COMPLETE", "CLEANUP"]

    elif risk_level == "MEDIUM":
        if change_type in ["documentation_only", "config_only"]:
            return base_states + ["COMPLETE", "CLEANUP"]
        else:
            return base_states + ["IMPLEMENTATION", "VALIDATION", "REVIEW", "COMPLETE", "CLEANUP"]

    elif risk_level == "LOW":
        return base_states + ["COMPLETE", "CLEANUP"]

    else:
        # Default to HIGH risk if uncertain
        return base_states + ["IMPLEMENTATION", "VALIDATION", "REVIEW", "COMPLETE", "CLEANUP"]
```

### Skip Condition Examples
**IMPLEMENTATION/VALIDATION State Skip Conditions:**
- Maven dependency additions (configuration only)
- Build plugin configuration changes
- Documentation updates without code references
- Property file modifications
- Version bumps without code changes
- README and markdown file updates
- Todo.md task tracking updates

**Full Validation Required Conditions:**
- Any source code modifications (*.java, *.js, *.py, etc.)
- Runtime behavior changes expected
- Security-sensitive configuration changes
- Build system modifications affecting compilation
- API contract modifications

## AGENT SELECTION DECISION TREE

### Comprehensive Agent Selection Framework
**Input**: Task description and file modification patterns
**Available Agents**: technical-architect, usability-reviewer, performance-analyzer, security-auditor, style-auditor, code-quality-auditor, code-tester, build-validator

**Processing Logic:**

**🚨 CORE AGENTS (Always Required):**
- **technical-architect**: MANDATORY for ALL file modification tasks (provides implementation requirements)

**🔍 FUNCTIONAL AGENTS (Code Implementation):**
- IF NEW CODE created: add style-auditor, code-quality-auditor, build-validator
- IF IMPLEMENTATION (not just config): add code-tester
- IF MAJOR FEATURES completed: add usability-reviewer (MANDATORY after completion)

**🛡️ SECURITY AGENTS (Actual Security Concerns):**
- IF AUTHENTICATION/AUTHORIZATION changes: add security-auditor
- IF EXTERNAL API/DATA integration: add security-auditor
- IF ENCRYPTION/CRYPTOGRAPHIC operations: add security-auditor
- IF INPUT VALIDATION/SANITIZATION: add security-auditor

**⚡ PERFORMANCE AGENTS (Performance Critical):**
- IF ALGORITHM optimization tasks: add performance-analyzer
- IF DATABASE/QUERY optimization: add performance-analyzer
- IF MEMORY/CPU intensive operations: add performance-analyzer

**🔧 FORMATTING AGENTS (Code Quality):**
- IF PARSER LOGIC modified: add performance-analyzer, security-auditor
- IF AST TRANSFORMATION changed: add code-quality-auditor, code-tester
- IF FORMATTING RULES affected: add style-auditor

**❌ AGENTS NOT NEEDED FOR SIMPLE OPERATIONS:**
- Maven module renames: NO performance-analyzer
- Configuration file updates: NO security-auditor unless changing auth
- Directory/file renames: NO performance-analyzer
- Documentation updates: Usually only technical-architect

**📊 ANALYSIS AGENTS (Research/Study Tasks):**
- IF ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS: add technical-architect
- IF PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: add performance-analyzer
- IF UX/INTERFACE ANALYSIS: add usability-reviewer
- IF SECURITY ANALYSIS: add security-auditor
- IF CODE QUALITY REVIEW: add code-quality-auditor
- IF PARSER/FORMATTER PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: add performance-analyzer

**Agent Selection Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] NEW CODE task → style-auditor included?
- [ ] Source files created/modified → build-validator included?
- [ ] Performance-critical code → performance-analyzer included?
- [ ] Security-sensitive features → security-auditor included?
- [ ] User-facing interfaces → usability-reviewer included?
- [ ] Post-implementation refactoring → code-quality-auditor included?
- [ ] AST parsing/code formatting → performance-analyzer included?

**Special Agent Usage Patterns:**
- **style-auditor**: Apply ALL manual style guide rules from docs/code-style/ (Java, common, and language-specific patterns)
- **build-validator**: For style/formatting tasks, triggers linters (checkstyle, PMD, ESLint) through build system
- **build-validator**: Use alongside style-auditor to ensure comprehensive validation (automated + manual rules)
- **code-quality-auditor**: Post-implementation refactoring and best practices enforcement
- **code-tester**: Business logic validation and comprehensive test creation
- **security-auditor**: Data handling and storage compliance review
- **performance-analyzer**: Algorithmic efficiency and resource optimization
- **usability-reviewer**: User experience design and interface evaluation
- **technical-architect**: System architecture and implementation guidance

## COMPLETE STYLE VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### Three-Component Style Validation
**MANDATORY PROCESS**: When style validation is required, ALL THREE components must pass:

1. **Automated Linters** (via build-validator):
   - `checkstyle`: Java coding conventions and formatting
   - `PMD`: Code quality and best practices
   - `ESLint`: JavaScript/TypeScript style (if applicable)

2. **Manual Style Rules** (via style-auditor):
   - Apply ALL detection patterns from `docs/code-style/*-claude.md`
   - Java-specific patterns (naming, structure, comments)
   - Common patterns (cross-language consistency)
   - Language-specific patterns as applicable

3. **Build Integration** (via build-validator):
   - Automated fixing when conflicts detected (LineLength vs UnderutilizedLines)
   - Use `checkstyle/fixers` module for AST-based consolidate-then-split strategy
   - Comprehensive testing validates fixing logic before application

### Complete Style Validation Gate Pattern
```bash
# MANDATORY: Never assume checkstyle-only validation
# CRITICAL ERROR PATTERN: Checking only checkstyle and declaring "no violations found" when PMD/manual violations exist

validate_complete_style_compliance() {
    echo "=== COMPLETE STYLE VALIDATION GATE ==="

    # Component 1: Automated linters via build system
    echo "Validating automated linters..."
    ./mvnw checkstyle:check || return 1
    ./mvnw pmd:check || return 1

    # Component 2: Manual style rules via style-auditor agent
    echo "Validating manual style rules..."
    invoke_style_auditor_with_manual_detection_patterns || return 1

    # Component 3: Automated fixing integration if conflicts
    echo "Checking for LineLength vs UnderutilizedLines conflicts..."
    if detect_style_conflicts; then
        echo "Applying automated AST-based fixes..."
        apply_automated_style_fixes || return 1
        # Re-validate after automated fixes
        validate_complete_style_compliance
    fi

    echo "✅ Complete style validation passed: checkstyle + PMD + manual rules"
    return 0
}
```

### Style Validation Integration Points
- **VALIDATION State**: Complete style validation before transitioning to REVIEW
- **build-validator Agent**: Triggers automated linters and reports results
- **style-auditor Agent**: Validates manual detection patterns from docs/code-style/
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic AST-based fixes when linter rules conflict
- **Evidence Requirement**: All three validation components must pass for ✅ APPROVED

## BATCH PROCESSING AND CONTINUOUS MODE

### Batch Processing Restrictions
**PROHIBITED PATTERNS:**
- Processing multiple tasks sequentially without individual protocol execution
- "Work on all Phase 1 tasks until done" - Must select ONE specific task
- "Complete these 5 tasks" - Each requires separate lock acquisition and worktree
- Assuming research tasks can bypass protocol because they create "only" study files

**MANDATORY SINGLE-TASK PROCESSING:**
1. Select ONE specific task from todo.md
2. Acquire atomic lock for THAT specific task only
3. Create isolated worktree for THAT task only
4. Execute full state machine protocol for THAT task only
5. Complete CLEANUP state before starting any other task

### Automatic Continuous Mode Translation
**When users request batch operations:**

**AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION PROTOCOL:**
1. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: "I understand you want to work on multiple tasks efficiently..."
2. **AUTO-TRANSLATE**: "I'll interpret this as a request to work on the todo list in continuous mode, processing each task with full protocol isolation..."
3. **EXECUTE**: Automatically trigger continuous workflow mode without requiring user to rephrase

**Batch Request Patterns to Auto-Translate:**
- "Work on all [phase/type] tasks"
- "Complete these tasks until done"
- "Process the todo list"
- "Work on multiple tasks"
- Any request mentioning multiple specific tasks

**Task Filtering for Continuous Mode:**
When batch requests specify subsets:
1. **Phase-based filtering**: Process only tasks in specified phases
2. **Type-based filtering**: Process only tasks matching specified types
3. **Name-based filtering**: Process only specifically mentioned task names
4. **Default behavior**: Process all available tasks if no filter mentioned

## 🧠 PROTOCOL INTERPRETATION MODE

**ENHANCED ANALYTICAL RIGOR**: Parent agent must apply deeper analysis when interpreting and following the task protocol workflow. Rather than surface-level interpretations, carefully analyze what the protocol truly requires for the specific task context.

**Critical Thinking Requirements:**
- Question assumptions about task scope and complexity
- Verify all transition conditions are genuinely met
- Apply evidence-based validation rather than procedural compliance
- Consider edge cases and alternative approaches
- Maintain skeptical evaluation of "good enough" solutions

## MANDATORY STATE TRANSITIONS

### state.json File Management
Every task MUST maintain a `state.json` file in the task directory containing:
```json
{
  "current_state": "STATE_NAME",
  "session_id": "session_uuid",
  "task_name": "task-name",
  "risk_level": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
  "required_agents": ["agent1", "agent2"],
  "evidence": {
    "REQUIREMENTS": ["file1.md", "file2.md"],
    "IMPLEMENTATION": ["sha256hash"],
    "VALIDATION": ["build_success_timestamp"],
    "REVIEW": {"agent1": "APPROVED", "agent2": "APPROVED"}
  },
  "transition_log": [
    {"from": "INIT", "to": "CLASSIFIED", "timestamp": "ISO8601", "evidence": "classification_reasoning"}
  ]
}
```

### INIT → CLASSIFIED
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] Session ID validated and unique
- [ ] Atomic lock acquired for task
- [ ] Task exists in todo.md
- [ ] Working directory confirmed as main branch

**Evidence Required:**
- Lock file creation timestamp
- Session ID validation output
- pwd verification showing `/workspace/branches/main/code`

**Implementation:**
```bash
export SESSION_ID="f33c1f04-94a5-4e87-9a87-4fcbc57bc8ec" && mkdir -p ../../../locks && (set -C; echo '{"session_id": "'${SESSION_ID}'", "start_time": "'$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')'"}' > ../../../locks/task-name.json) && echo "LOCK_SUCCESS" || echo "LOCK_FAILED"
```

### CLASSIFIED → REQUIREMENTS
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] Risk level determined (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- [ ] Agent set selected based on risk classification
- [ ] Worktree isolation established (for HIGH/MEDIUM risk)
- [ ] Context.md created with explicit scope boundaries

**Evidence Required:**
- Risk classification reasoning documented
- Worktree creation verification (`pwd` shows task directory)
- Agent selection justification based on file patterns
- Context.md exists with mandatory sections

**Implementation:**
```bash
cd /workspace/branches/main/code
git worktree add -b task-name /workspace/branches/task-name/code
cd /workspace/branches/task-name/code
```

### REQUIREMENTS → SYNTHESIS
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] ALL required agents invoked in parallel
- [ ] ALL agents provided complete requirement reports
- [ ] ALL agent reports written to `../{agent-name}-requirements.md`
- [ ] NO agent failures or incomplete responses
- [ ] Requirements synthesis document created
- [ ] Architecture plan addresses all stakeholder requirements
- [ ] Conflict resolution documented for competing requirements
- [ ] Implementation strategy defined with clear success criteria

**Evidence Required:**
- Agent report files exist and contain complete analysis
- Each agent response includes domain-specific requirements
- All conflicts between agent requirements identified
- Synthesis document exists with all sections completed
- Each agent requirement mapped to implementation approach
- Trade-off decisions documented with rationale
- Success criteria defined for each domain (architecture, security, performance, etc.)

**Detailed Synthesis Process Pattern:**
```
MANDATORY AFTER REQUIREMENTS completion:
1. CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Identify competing requirements between domains
   - Compare technical-architect vs performance-analyzer requirements
   - Resolve style-auditor vs code-quality-auditor conflicts
   - Balance security-auditor vs usability-reviewer trade-offs

2. ARCHITECTURE PLANNING: Design approach satisfying all constraints
   - Document chosen architectural patterns
   - Specify integration points between components
   - Define interface contracts and data flows

3. REQUIREMENT MAPPING: Document how each stakeholder requirement is addressed
   - Map each technical-architect requirement to implementation component
   - Map each security-auditor requirement to security control
   - Map each performance-analyzer requirement to optimization strategy

4. TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS: Record decisions and compromises
   - Document rejected alternatives and reasons
   - Record acceptable compromises with risk assessment
   - Define success criteria for each domain

5. IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION PLANNING:
   - Write complete, functional code addressing all requirements
   - Document design decisions and rationale
   - Follow established project patterns
   - Edit: todo.md (mark task complete) - MUST be included in same commit as task deliverables

VIOLATION CHECK: All REQUIREMENTS state agent feedback addressed or exceptions documented

⚠️ CRITICAL COMMIT PATTERN VIOLATION: Never create separate commits for todo.md updates
MANDATORY: todo.md task completion update MUST be committed with task deliverables in single atomic commit
ANTI-PATTERN: git commit deliverables → git commit todo.md (VIOLATES PROTOCOL)
CORRECT PATTERN: git add deliverables todo.md → git commit (single atomic commit)
```

**Validation Function:**
```python
def validate_requirements_complete(required_agents, task_dir):
    for agent in required_agents:
        report_file = f"{task_dir}/../{agent}-requirements.md"
        if not os.path.exists(report_file):
            return False, f"Missing report: {report_file}"
        # Additional validation: file is non-empty, contains analysis
    return True, "All requirements complete"
```

### SYNTHESIS → IMPLEMENTATION
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] Requirements synthesis document created
- [ ] Architecture plan addresses all stakeholder requirements
- [ ] Conflict resolution documented for competing requirements
- [ ] Implementation strategy defined with clear success criteria

**Evidence Required:**
- Synthesis document exists with all sections completed
- Each agent requirement mapped to implementation approach
- Trade-off decisions documented with rationale
- Success criteria defined for each domain (architecture, security, performance, etc.)

### IMPLEMENTATION → VALIDATION
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] All planned deliverables created
- [ ] Implementation follows synthesis architecture plan
- [ ] Code adheres to project conventions and patterns
- [ ] All requirements from synthesis addressed or deferred with justification

**Evidence Required:**
- Git diff showing all implemented changes
- File creation/modification timestamps
- Implementation matches synthesis plan
- Any requirement deferrals properly documented in todo.md

### VALIDATION → REVIEW (Conditional Path)
**Path Selection Logic:**
```
IF (source_code_modified OR runtime_behavior_changed):
    EXECUTE full validation sequence
    REQUIRED CONDITIONS:
    - [ ] Build validation passes (./mvnw clean compile test)
    - [ ] All automated quality gates pass
    - [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges (if applicable)
    - [ ] Security scanning clean (if applicable)
ELSE:
    SKIP to REVIEW with documentation-only validation
```

**Evidence Required (Full Path):**
- Build success output with zero exit code
- Quality gate results (checkstyle, PMD, etc.)
- Test execution results showing all tests pass
- Performance baseline comparison (if performance-critical changes)

**Evidence Required (Skip Path):**
- Documentation that no runtime behavior changes
- Verification that only configuration/documentation modified
- Build system confirms no code compilation required

### REVIEW → COMPLETE (Unanimous Approval Gate)
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] ALL required agents invoked for final system review
- [ ] ALL agents return exactly: "FINAL DECISION: ✅ APPROVED - [reason]"
- [ ] NO agent returns: "FINAL DECISION: ❌ REJECTED - [issues]"
- [ ] Review evidence documented in `state.json` file

**Enforcement Logic:**
```python
def validate_unanimous_approval(agent_responses):
    for agent, response in agent_responses.items():
        if "FINAL DECISION: ✅ APPROVED" not in response:
            if "FINAL DECISION: ❌ REJECTED" in response:
                return False, f"Agent {agent} rejected with specific issues"
            else:
                return False, f"Agent {agent} provided malformed decision format"
    return True, "Unanimous approval achieved"
```

**CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- **NO HUMAN OVERRIDE**: Agent decisions are atomic and binding
- **MANDATORY RESOLUTION**: ANY ❌ REJECTED triggers either resolution cycle OR scope negotiation

**Scope Assessment Decision Logic:**
```python
def handle_agent_rejections(rejecting_agents, rejection_feedback):
    # Estimate resolution effort complexity
    if estimated_resolution_effort > (2 * original_task_scope):
        # Trigger scope negotiation
        return transition_to_scope_negotiation(rejecting_agents, rejection_feedback)
    else:
        # Standard resolution cycle
        return transition_to_synthesis_cycle()
```

**Prohibited Bypass Patterns:**
❌ "Proceeding despite minor rejections"
❌ "Issues are enhancement-level, not blocking"
❌ "Critical functionality complete, finalizing"

**Required Response to ❌ REJECTED:**
✅ "Agent [name] returned ❌ REJECTED, analyzing resolution scope..."
✅ IF (resolution effort ≤ 2x task scope): "Returning to SYNTHESIS state to address: [specific issues]"
✅ IF (resolution effort > 2x task scope): "Transitioning to SCOPE_NEGOTIATION state for scope assessment"
✅ "Cannot advance to COMPLETE until ALL agents return ✅ APPROVED"

### REVIEW → SCOPE_NEGOTIATION (Conditional Transition)
**Trigger Conditions:**
- [ ] Multiple agents returned ❌ REJECTED with extensive scope concerns
- [ ] Estimated resolution effort exceeds 2x original task scope
- [ ] Issues span multiple domains requiring significant rework

**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] All rejecting agents re-invoked with SCOPE_NEGOTIATION mode
- [ ] Each agent classifies rejected items as BLOCKING vs DEFERRABLE
- [ ] Domain authority assignments respected for final decisions
- [ ] Scope negotiation results documented in `state.json` file

**Evidence Required:**
- Scope assessment from each rejecting agent
- Classification of issues (BLOCKING/DEFERRABLE) with justification
- Domain authority decisions documented
- Follow-up tasks created in todo.md for deferred work

### SCOPE_NEGOTIATION → SYNTHESIS (Return Path) or SCOPE_NEGOTIATION → COMPLETE (Deferral Path)
**Decision Logic:**
```python
def process_scope_negotiation_results(agent_responses):
    blocking_issues = []
    deferrable_issues = []

    for agent, response in agent_responses.items():
        if "SCOPE_DECISION: RESOLVE_NOW" in response:
            blocking_issues.extend(extract_blocking_issues(response))
        elif "SCOPE_DECISION: DEFER" in response:
            deferrable_issues.extend(extract_deferrable_issues(response))

    if blocking_issues:
        return "TRANSITION_TO_SYNTHESIS", blocking_issues
    else:
        return "TRANSITION_TO_COMPLETE", deferrable_issues
```

**Transition to SYNTHESIS (Full Resolution Path):**
- ANY agent determines issues are BLOCKING and must be resolved
- Return to SYNTHESIS state with reduced scope focusing on blocking issues
- Deferred issues added to todo.md as follow-up tasks

**Transition to COMPLETE (Deferral Path):**
- ALL agents agree issues are DEFERRABLE beyond current task scope
- Core functionality preserved, enhancements deferred
- All deferred work properly documented in todo.md with specific task entries

**Domain Authority Framework:**
- **security-auditor**: Absolute veto on security vulnerabilities and privacy violations
- **build-validator**: Final authority on deployment safety and build integrity
- **technical-architect**: Final authority on architectural completeness requirements
- **performance-analyzer**: Authority on performance requirements and scalability
- **code-quality-auditor**: Can defer documentation/testing if basic quality maintained
- **style-auditor**: Can defer style issues if core functionality preserved
- **code-tester**: Authority on test coverage adequacy for business logic
- **usability-reviewer**: Can defer UX improvements if core functionality accessible

**Security Auditor Configuration:**
**CRITICAL: Use Project-Specific Security Model from scope.md**

For Parser Implementation Tasks:
- **Attack Model**: Single-user code formatting scenarios (see docs/project/scope.md)
- **Security Focus**: Resource exhaustion prevention, system stability
- **NOT in Scope**: Information disclosure, data exfiltration, multi-user attacks
- **Usability Priority**: Error messages should prioritize debugging assistance
- **Appropriate Limits**: Reasonable protection for legitimate code formatting use cases

**MANDATORY**: security-auditor MUST reference docs/project/scope.md "Security Model for Parser Operations" before conducting any parser security review.

**Authority Hierarchy for Domain Conflicts:**
When agent authorities overlap or conflict:
- Security/Privacy conflicts: Joint veto power (both security-auditor AND security-auditor must approve)
- Architecture/Performance conflicts: technical-architect decides with performance-analyzer input
- Build/Architecture conflicts: build-validator has final authority (deployment safety priority)
- Testing/Quality conflicts: code-tester decides coverage adequacy, code-quality-auditor decides standards
- Style/Quality conflicts: code-quality-auditor decides (quality encompasses style)

**Scope Negotiation Agent Prompt Template:**
```python
scope_negotiation_prompt = """
Task: {task_description}
Mode: SCOPE_NEGOTIATION
Current State: SCOPE_NEGOTIATION → SYNTHESIS or COMPLETE pending
Your Previous Rejection: {rejection_feedback}
Core Task Scope: {original_task_definition}

CRITICAL PERSISTENCE REQUIREMENTS:
Apply CLAUDE.md "Deferral Justification Requirements" and "Prohibited Deferral Reasons".
Only defer if work genuinely extends beyond task boundaries, requires unavailable expertise,
is blocked by external factors, or genuinely exceeds reasonable allocation.

NEVER defer because:
❌ "This is harder than expected"
❌ "The easy solution works fine"
❌ "Perfect is the enemy of good"

SCOPE DECISION REQUEST:
Classify your rejected items based on original task scope:

BLOCKING ISSUES (must resolve now):
- Issues that prevent core functionality
- Issues that compromise long-term solution quality within achievable scope
- Issues within your domain authority that cannot be safely deferred

DEFERRABLE ISSUES (can add to todo.md):
- Issues that enhance but don't block core task
- Issues that genuinely exceed reasonable task boundaries
- Issues that can become standalone follow-up tasks

MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT:
BLOCKING ISSUES: [list specific items that absolutely must be resolved]
DEFERRABLE ISSUES: [list items that can become follow-up tasks]
PERSISTENCE JUSTIFICATION: [explain why deferrable items genuinely exceed scope vs. requiring more effort]
SCOPE_DECISION: DEFER or RESOLVE_NOW

If DEFER: Provide exact todo.md task entries for deferred work
If RESOLVE_NOW: Confirm all issues must be resolved in current task
"""
```

### COMPLETE → CLEANUP
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] All work committed to task branch with descriptive commit message
- [ ] Task branch merged to main branch via fast-forward merge
- [ ] todo.md updated to mark task complete (in same commit as deliverables)
- [ ] Build verification passes on main branch after merge

**Evidence Required:**
- Git log showing clean merge to main
- todo.md modification included in final commit
- Main branch build success after integration
- All deliverables preserved in main branch

**Git Safety Sequence:**
```bash
# Ensure clean working state
rm -f .temp_dir
git status --porcelain | grep -E "(dist/|target/|\.temp_dir$)" | wc -l  # Must be 0

# Linear merge requirement
git rebase main
cd /workspace/branches/main/code
git merge --ff-only task-name

# Verification
git log --oneline -3  # Verify linear history
./mvnw clean verify -q  # Verify build integrity
```

### CLEANUP (Final State)
**Mandatory Conditions:**
- [ ] Task lock released
- [ ] Worktree removed safely
- [ ] Task branch deleted
- [ ] Temporary files cleaned
- [ ] `state.json` file archived

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Verify work preserved before cleanup
cd /workspace/branches/main/code
git log --oneline -5 | grep "task-name" || exit 1

# Safe cleanup sequence
rm -f ../../../locks/task-name.json
cd /workspace/branches/main/code
git worktree remove /workspace/branches/task-name/code
git branch -d task-name
rm -rf /workspace/branches/task-name

# Temporary file cleanup
TEMP_DIR=$(cat .temp_dir 2>/dev/null) && [ -n "$TEMP_DIR" ] && rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"
```

## TRANSITION VALIDATION FUNCTIONS

### Universal Validation Requirements
Every transition MUST execute these checks:

```python
def validate_transition_conditions(from_state, to_state, evidence, task_context):
    """Validate that all mandatory conditions for transition are met"""

    # Load transition requirements
    required_conditions = TRANSITION_MAP[from_state][to_state]['conditions']
    required_evidence = TRANSITION_MAP[from_state][to_state]['evidence']

    # Validate each condition
    for condition in required_conditions:
        if not validate_condition(condition, evidence, task_context):
            return False, f"Condition failed: {condition}"

    # Validate required evidence exists
    for evidence_type in required_evidence:
        if not validate_evidence(evidence_type, evidence):
            return False, f"Missing evidence: {evidence_type}"

    return True, "All transition conditions satisfied"

def validate_condition(condition, evidence, context):
    """Validate specific transition condition"""
    # Implementation specific to each condition type
    pass

def validate_evidence(evidence_type, evidence_data):
    """Validate required evidence exists and is complete"""
    # Implementation specific to each evidence type
    pass
```

### State Enforcement Functions

```bash
# Function: Update task state
update_task_state() {
    local new_state=$1
    local evidence_json=$2

    # Validate transition is legal
    current_state=$(jq -r '.current_state' state.json 2>/dev/null || echo "INIT")
    if ! validate_state_transition "$current_state" "$new_state"; then
        echo "ERROR: Invalid transition from $current_state to $new_state"
        exit 1
    fi

    # Update state file
    jq --arg state "$new_state" \
       --argjson evidence "$evidence_json" \
       --arg timestamp "$(date -Iseconds)" \
       '.current_state = $state |
        .evidence += $evidence |
        .transition_log += [{"from": .current_state, "to": $state, "timestamp": $timestamp}]' \
       state.json > state.json.tmp && mv state.json.tmp state.json
}

# Function: Validate state transition
validate_state_transition() {
    local from_state=$1
    local to_state=$2

    case "$from_state:$to_state" in
        # Standard transitions
        "INIT:CLASSIFIED"|"CLASSIFIED:REQUIREMENTS"|"REQUIREMENTS:SYNTHESIS"|"SYNTHESIS:IMPLEMENTATION"|"IMPLEMENTATION:VALIDATION"|"VALIDATION:REVIEW"|"REVIEW:COMPLETE"|"COMPLETE:CLEANUP")
            return 0 ;;
        # Scope negotiation transitions
        "REVIEW:SCOPE_NEGOTIATION"|"SCOPE_NEGOTIATION:SYNTHESIS"|"SCOPE_NEGOTIATION:COMPLETE")
            return 0 ;;
        # Conditional skip transitions for low/medium risk
        "SYNTHESIS:COMPLETE"|"CLASSIFIED:COMPLETE"|"REQUIREMENTS:COMPLETE")
            return 0 ;;
        # Resolution cycle transitions
        "SYNTHESIS:IMPLEMENTATION"|"IMPLEMENTATION:SYNTHESIS"|"VALIDATION:SYNTHESIS")
            return 0 ;;
        *)
            return 1 ;;
    esac
}
```

## AGENT INTERACTION PROTOCOLS

### Parallel Agent Invocation Pattern
```python
# Template for requirements gathering
agent_prompt_template = """
Task: {task_description}
Mode: REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS
Current State: REQUIREMENTS → SYNTHESIS transition pending
Your Domain: {agent_domain}
Risk Level: {risk_level}

CRITICAL SCOPE ENFORCEMENT:
Only analyze files in ../context.md scope section.
STOP IMMEDIATELY if attempting unauthorized file access.

MANDATORY PERSISTENCE REQUIREMENTS:
Apply CLAUDE.md "Long-term Solution Persistence" principles.
Reject incomplete solutions when optimal solutions are achievable.
Use "Solution Quality Hierarchy" - prioritize OPTIMAL over EXPEDIENT.

MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:

End with: "REQUIREMENTS COMPLETE: {agent_domain} analysis provided"

MANDATORY EVIDENCE REQUIREMENT:
Document specific {agent_domain} requirements that implementation must satisfy.
Include success criteria, constraints, and quality thresholds.
"""

# Implementation
def invoke_requirements_agents(required_agents, task_context):
    agent_calls = []

## ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY

### Transition Failure Recovery
```python
def handle_transition_failure(current_state, attempted_state, failure_reason):
    """Handle failed state transitions with appropriate recovery"""

    recovery_actions = {
        'REQUIREMENTS': {

    }

    action = recovery_actions.get(current_state, {}).get(failure_reason, 'restart_from_synthesis')
    execute_recovery_action(action, current_state, attempted_state, failure_reason)
```

### Multi-Instance Coordination
```bash
# Lock conflict resolution
handle_lock_conflict() {
    local task_name=$1

    echo "Lock conflict detected for task: $task_name"
    echo "Checking for available alternative tasks..."

    # Find next available task

```

## COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

### Pre-Task Validation Checklist
```bash
# MANDATORY before ANY task execution
pre_task_validation() {
    echo "=== PRE-TASK VALIDATION ==="

    }

    echo "✅ Final compliance audit passed"
}
```

## VIOLATION PREVENTION PATTERNS

### Pre-Task Validation Block
**MANDATORY before ANY task execution:**
```bash
# Session ID validation
export SESSION_ID="f33c1f04-94a5-4e87-9a87-4fcbc57bc8ec" && [ -n "$SESSION_ID" ] && [ "$SESSION_ID" != "REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_SESSION_ID" ] && echo "SESSION_ID_VALID: $SESSION_ID" || (echo "SESSION_ID_INVALID" && exit 1)

# Working directory verification
[ "$(pwd)" = "/workspace/branches/main/code" ] || (echo "ERROR: Wrong directory" && exit 1)

# Todo.md accessibility
[ -f "todo.md" ] || (echo "ERROR: todo.md not accessible" && exit 1)
```

### Mandatory Context.md Creation
**Required BEFORE any stakeholder consultation:**
```markdown
# Task Context: {task-name}

## Task Objective
{task-description}

## Scope Definition
**FILES IN SCOPE:**
- [List exact files/directories that stakeholder agents are authorized to analyze]

**FILES OUT OF SCOPE:**
- [List directories/files explicitly excluded from analysis]

## Stakeholder Agent Reports
**Requirements Phase:**
- technical-architect-requirements.md (when completed)
- [other-agent]-requirements.md (when completed)

**Implementation Reviews:**
- technical-architect-review1.md (when completed)
- [other-agent]-review1.md (when completed)

## Implementation Status
- [ ] INIT: Task initialization
- [ ] CLASSIFIED: Risk assessment
- [ ] REQUIREMENTS: Stakeholder analysis
- [ ] SYNTHESIS: Architecture planning
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION: Code creation
- [ ] VALIDATION: Build verification
- [ ] REVIEW: Final approval
- [ ] COMPLETE: Work preservation
- [ ] CLEANUP: Resource cleanup
```

### Atomic Lock Acquisition Pattern
```bash
# MANDATORY atomic lock acquisition
export SESSION_ID="f33c1f04-94a5-4e87-9a87-4fcbc57bc8ec" && mkdir -p ../../../locks && (set -C; echo '{"session_id": "'${SESSION_ID}'", "start_time": "'$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')'"}' > ../../../locks/{task-name}.json) 2>/dev/null && echo "LOCK_SUCCESS" || echo "LOCK_FAILED"

# Violation check
if [[ "$lock_result" != *"LOCK_SUCCESS"* ]]; then
    echo "Lock acquisition failed - selecting alternative task"
    select_alternative_task
fi
```

### Temporary File Management Setup
**BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS (Mandatory for all tasks):**
```bash
# TEMP_DIRECTORY_CREATION: Set up isolated temporary file space
TASK_NAME=$(basename $(dirname $(pwd)))
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/task-${TASK_NAME}-$(date +%s)-$$" && mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR"
echo "$TEMP_DIR" > .temp_dir && echo "TEMP_SETUP_SUCCESS: $TEMP_DIR"

# PURPOSE: All agents use consistent temporary file location outside git repository
# USAGE: Agents read temp directory with: TEMP_DIR=$(cat .temp_dir 2>/dev/null || echo "/tmp/fallback-$$")

# VIOLATION CHECK: Output must contain "TEMP_SETUP_SUCCESS"
if [[ "$temp_result" != *"TEMP_SETUP_SUCCESS"* ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: Temp directory creation failed - using task directory as fallback"
    TEMP_DIR=$(pwd)/.temp_fallback && mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR"
fi
```

**AGENT INTEGRATION**: All agents should use temporary directory for:
- Analysis scripts and automation tools
- Performance benchmarking artifacts
- Security testing payloads and samples
- Debug logs and intermediate processing files
- Generated test data and mock objects

### Implementation Safety Guards
**Before ANY Write/Edit/MultiEdit operation:**
```bash
# Working directory validation
pwd | grep -q "/workspace/branches/.*/code$" || (echo "ERROR: Invalid working directory" && exit 1)

# Clean repository state
git status --porcelain | grep -E "(dist/|node_modules/|target/|\.jar$)" && (echo "ERROR: Prohibited files detected" && exit 1)
```

### Build Validation Gates
**Mandatory after implementation:**
```bash
# Compile and test validation
./mvnw clean compile test -q || (echo "ERROR: Build/test failure" && exit 1)

# Full verification before completion
./mvnw clean verify -q || (echo "ERROR: Full build failure - task cannot be completed" && exit 1)
```

### Decision Parsing Enforcement
**After ANY agent invocation:**
```bash
# Extract agent decision
decision=$(echo "$agent_response" | grep "FINAL DECISION:")

if [[ -z "$decision" ]]; then
    # Retry with format clarification
    retry_agent_with_format_requirement
elif [[ "$decision" == *"❌ REJECTED"* ]]; then
    # Handle rejection appropriately
    handle_agent_rejection
elif [[ "$decision" == *"✅ APPROVED"* ]]; then
    # Continue workflow
    continue_to_next_transition
fi
```

### Protocol Violation Reporting Pattern
```
MAINTAIN THROUGHOUT TASK EXECUTION:
1. Track all format violations in TodoWrite tool as separate item
2. Record: Agent type, state, violation type, retry outcome
3. Include in final task summary for human review

VIOLATION REPORT FORMAT:
"Protocol Violations Detected:
- [Agent]: [State] - Missing decision format (resolved via retry)
- [Agent]: [State] - Malformed decision (assumed REJECTED)
- Total violations: X, Auto-resolved: Y, Manual review needed: Z"

PURPOSE:
- Identify agent prompt issues needing refinement
- Track protocol compliance trends over time
- Enable proactive protocol improvements
- Maintain audit trail for debugging

IMPLEMENTATION:
violation_tracking = {
    "agent_name": {
        "state": "REVIEW",
        "violation_type": "missing_decision_format",
        "retry_outcome": "resolved",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    }
}

# Add to TodoWrite tracking
update_todo_with_violation_report()
```

## CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULES

### Single Session Continuity
**Requirements:**
- All task execution in single Claude session
- NO HANDOFFS: Complete task without waiting for user input
- IF session interrupted: Restart task from beginning with new session

### Tool Call Batching
**Optimization patterns:**
```python
# Batch related operations in single message
parallel_tool_calls = [
    {"tool": "Task", "agent": "technical-architect", "mode": "requirements"},
    {"tool": "Task", "agent": "style-auditor", "mode": "requirements"},
    {"tool": "Task", "agent": "code-quality-auditor", "mode": "requirements"}
]

# Execute all in single message to reduce context fragmentation
execute_parallel_tools(parallel_tool_calls)
```

### State Persistence Patterns
**Critical state tracking:**
- Current state in state.json file
- Session ID in environment variables
- Working directory verification
- Lock status confirmation

**Verify state before each major operation:**
```bash
# State consistency check
current_state=$(jq -r '.current_state' state.json)
expected_state="$1"
[ "$current_state" = "$expected_state" ] || (echo "ERROR: State inconsistency" && exit 1)
```

## TOOL-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS

### Bash Tool Usage
```bash
# Combine related operations with safety checks
command1 && echo "SUCCESS" || (echo "FAILED" && exit 1)

# Verify outputs before proceeding
result=$(command_with_output)
[ -n "$result" ] || (echo "ERROR: Command produced no output" && exit 1)

# Avoid interactive commands
# ❌ git rebase -i
# ✅ git rebase main
```

### Read Tool Usage
```python
# Batch reads for related content
related_files = [
    "/path/to/config.md",
    "/path/to/implementation.java",
    "/path/to/test.java"
]

# Read multiple files in sequence within single operation
for file_path in related_files:
    content = read_tool(file_path)
    analyze_content(content)
```

### Task Tool Usage
```python
# Parallel agent calls in single message
agent_calls = [
    {
        'subagent_type': 'technical-architect',
        'description': 'Architecture requirements',
        'prompt': structured_prompt_template.format(domain='architecture')
    },
    {
        'subagent_type': 'style-auditor',
        'description': 'Style requirements',
        'prompt': structured_prompt_template.format(domain='style')
    }
]

# Execute all agents simultaneously
execute_parallel_agents(agent_calls)
```

### TodoWrite Tool Usage
```python
# Frequent progress updates
update_todo_progress("requirements", "in_progress", "Gathering stakeholder requirements")

# Consistent format patterns
todo_item = {
    "content": "Implement feature X with requirements Y",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "activeForm": "Implementing feature X according to stakeholder specifications"
}

# State verification through TodoWrite
verify_workflow_position_via_todo_state()
```

## ERROR RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

### Violation Detection Triggers
**Automatic violation detection:**
- Wrong directory (pwd check fails)
- Missing locks (lock file check fails)
- Build failures (non-zero exit codes)
- Git operation failures (rebase/merge fails)
- Prohibited files detected (status check fails)

**Recovery Action**: TERMINATE current task, restart from INIT state

### Multi-Instance Conflict Resolution
**Lock conflict handling:**
```bash
handle_lock_conflict() {
    local task_name=$1
    echo "Lock conflict detected for task: $task_name"

    # Find alternative available task
    available_task=$(find_next_available_task)

    if [ -n "$available_task" ]; then
        echo "Selected alternative task: $available_task"
        execute_task_protocol "$available_task"
    else
        echo "No available tasks found. Exiting."
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

### Partial Completion Recovery
**Task interruption handling:**
```bash
if [ -f "state.json" ]; then
    session_id=$(jq -r '.session_id' state.json)
    current_session="$SESSION_ID"

    if [ "$session_id" = "$current_session" ]; then
        # Resume from last completed state
        resume_from_last_state
    else
        # Foreign session - select different task
        select_alternative_task
    fi
fi
```

## WORKFLOW EXECUTION ENGINE

### Main Task Execution Function
```bash
execute_task_protocol() {
    local task_name=$1

    # Initialize state machine
    initialize_task_state "$task_name"

    # Execute state machine with risk-based path selection
    while [ "$(get_current_state)" != "CLEANUP" ]; do
        current_state=$(get_current_state)
        risk_level=$(jq -r '.risk_level' state.json 2>/dev/null || echo "HIGH")
        change_type=$(determine_change_type)

        echo "=== STATE: $current_state (Risk: $risk_level, Type: $change_type) ==="

        case "$current_state" in
            "INIT")
                execute_init_to_classified_transition

                    execute_synthesis_to_complete_transition
                else

## MIGRATION FROM PHASE-BASED PROTOCOL

### Compatibility Layer
All existing CLAUDE.md references to "phases" map to states as follows:
- Phase 1 = REQUIREMENTS state
- Phase 2 = SYNTHESIS state
- Phase 3 = IMPLEMENTATION state
- Phase 4 = Part of VALIDATION state
- Phase 5 = Resolution cycle (SYNTHESIS ↔ IMPLEMENTATION ↔ VALIDATION)
- Phase 6 = REVIEW state
- Phase 7 = CLEANUP state

### Transition Period Support
During migration, both terminologies are recognized:
- "Execute Phase 1" → "Transition to REQUIREMENTS state"
- "Phase 6 rejection" → "REVIEW state rejection, return to SYNTHESIS"
- "Phase guards" → "Transition conditions"

### Zero Tolerance Enforcement
Unlike the previous phase-based system with optional "phase guards," this state machine implements **mandatory transition conditions**. There are no manual overrides, no "reasonable approximation" exceptions, and no human discretion in bypassing required validations.
