## 🧠 Philosophy and Principles

### Why Code Style Matters in Code Formatter Development

This codebase implements Styler, a Java code formatter that processes source code and applies formatting transformations. Code quality is critical because:

- **Parse Accuracy**: Errors in AST parsing could corrupt source code or lose formatting information
- **Performance Requirements**: Code formatters must process large codebases efficiently with minimal latency
- **System Reliability**: Formatters must handle malformed code gracefully without data loss
- **Team Productivity**: Consistent code style reduces cognitive load and speeds development
- **Long-term Maintenance**: Parser and formatter logic must evolve with Java language changes

### Core Design Principles

1. **Fail-Fast Validation**: Detect parse errors as early as possible in AST construction
2. **Performance Over Precision**: Optimize for speed and memory efficiency in large codebases
3. **Fidelity Preservation**: All source code transformations must preserve developer intent and comments
4. **Immutability**: AST data structures should prevent accidental modification during formatting
5. **Type Safety**: Use strong typing to prevent confusion between tokens, nodes, and trivia elements

## 📚 Understanding the Documentation Structure

> **Quick Start**: New to the project? Start with [Common Practices](code-style/common-human.md) then move to your language-specific guide.

### Language-Specific Guides
- **[Common Practices](code-style/common-human.md)**: Universal principles applying to all code
- **[Java Patterns](code-style/java-human.md)**: JVM-specific patterns for AST parsing and code formatting  
- **[TypeScript Practices](code-style/typescript-human.md)**: Type-safe frontend development
- **[Testing Conventions](code-style/testing-human.md)**: Testing patterns, parallel execution, and JPMS structure

### Rule Priority Levels

**TIER 1 CRITICAL**: Build blockers and parsing accuracy issues
- These rules prevent compilation failures or parsing errors
- Violations must be fixed before code review approval
- Examples: AST fidelity, input validation, source position tracking

**TIER 2 IMPORTANT**: Maintainability and business logic patterns
- These rules affect code quality and team productivity
- Should be addressed during code review
- Examples: Error message context, proper exception types, design patterns

**TIER 3 QUALITY**: Best practices and conventions
- These rules improve readability and long-term maintainability
- Can be addressed in follow-up improvements
- Examples: Method length, parameter count, naming conventions

## 🛠 Working with Different Codebase Types

### Pure Java Projects
**Focus Areas**: AST parsing accuracy, JVM optimization, compiler patterns
**Key Concerns**: Parser performance, validation frameworks, language feature support
**Reference**: [Java Style Guide](code-style/java-human.md) for detailed Java-specific guidance

### Pure TypeScript Projects  
**Focus Areas**: Type safety, API contracts, frontend reliability
**Key Concerns**: Interface design, null safety, build-time validation
**Reference**: [TypeScript Style Guide](code-style/typescript-human.md) for TypeScript-specific guidance

### Mixed Language Projects
**Coordination Strategy**: 
- Maintain consistent business logic patterns across languages
- Use TypeScript interfaces that match Java domain objects
- Apply common formatting and style rules uniformly
- Ensure API contracts are type-safe on both ends

## ⚙️ Development Workflow Integration

### Before Writing Code
1. **Understand Domain Context**: Review Java parsing and formatting requirements
2. **Choose Appropriate Patterns**: Select patterns based on business logic complexity
3. **Plan Validation Strategy**: Determine fail-fast validation points
4. **Consider Test Strategy**: Plan how to verify parsing and formatting accuracy

### During Development
1. **Apply TIER 1 Rules**: Ensure build won't fail and calculations are accurate
2. **Follow Language Patterns**: Use established patterns from language-specific guides
3. **Write Parallel-Safe Tests**: Follow [Testing Conventions](code-style/testing-human.md) for thread-safe test design
4. **Document Business Logic**: Add context for complex parsing transformations
5. **Validate Edge Cases**: Consider boundary conditions for malformed source code

### Code Review Process
1. **Automated Checks**: Run linting and build validation first
2. **TIER 1 Verification**: Verify critical parsing accuracy rules
3. **Test Quality Review**: Ensure tests follow [parallel execution safety rules](code-style/testing-human.md#parallel-test-execution-requirements)
4. **Business Logic Review**: Check calculation logic against requirements
5. **Documentation Review**: Ensure external sources are properly referenced
6. **TIER 2/3 Assessment**: Evaluate maintainability and best practices

## 🚫 Common Anti-Patterns in Parser/Formatter Code

### Precision Anti-Patterns
❌ **Using floats for source positions**: `float linePosition = 15.5f;`
✅ **Using exact integers**: `int lineNumber = 15; int columnNumber = 5;`

### Validation Anti-Patterns
❌ **No validation**: `public void setSourceCode(String source) { this.source = source; }`
✅ **Fail-fast validation**: `requireThat(source, "source").isNotNull().isNotBlank();`

### Documentation Anti-Patterns
❌ **Magic parsing**: `depth = maxDepth * 2;`
✅ **Documented constants**: `// JLS §14.4 defines maximum nesting depth for block statements\ndepth = calculateNestingDepth(MAX_BLOCK_DEPTH);`

### Error Handling Anti-Patterns
❌ **Generic exceptions**: `throw new Exception("Invalid input");`
✅ **Parser context**: `throw new ParseException("Nesting depth " + depth + " exceeds maximum " + MAX_DEPTH + " at line " + line);`

## 🔧 Integration with Build Process

### Automated Enforcement
- **Linting**: Catches formatting and basic style violations
- **Type Checking**: Ensures type safety in TypeScript code
- **Unit Tests**: Validates parsing and formatting accuracy
- **Integration Tests**: Verifies end-to-end calculation workflows

### Manual Review Focus
- **Parser Accuracy**: Verify AST construction matches Java language specification
- **Formatting Fidelity**: Check comment and whitespace preservation
- **Edge Case Handling**: Review boundary conditions for malformed source code
- **Performance Considerations**: Assess scalability for large codebases

### Automated Style Fixing Tools

**Styler Format Engine**: For code formatting and style enforcement
- **Location**: `styler-core` Maven module
- **Strategy**: AST-based formatting approach with trivia preservation
- **Usage**: Command-line interface for batch formatting operations
- **Main Class**: `io.github.styler.cli.StylerCLI`
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage validating comment preservation and format fidelity

**Consolidate-Then-Split Strategy**:
1. **Consolidate**: Multi-line constructs → single line format
2. **Evaluate**: Check if consolidated line ≤ 120 characters
3. **Split**: If too long, split at semantic boundaries (parameters, strings)
4. **Result**: Resolves UnderutilizedLines while respecting LineLength limits

## 📈 Continuous Improvement

### Regular Updates
- **Java Language Evolution**: Update parser for new JDK features
- **Formatting Standards**: Evolve rules based on community feedback and usage patterns
- **Pattern Evolution**: Refine patterns based on team experience and new requirements

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Violation Trend Analysis**: Track style violation rates over time
- **Parser Accuracy Testing**: Monitor AST fidelity in automated tests
- **Code Review Effectiveness**: Measure defect catch rate in reviews
- **Team Productivity**: Assess impact of style consistency on development speed
