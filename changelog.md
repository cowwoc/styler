### Task: `setup-maven-multi-module-build` - Create Maven parent POM and module structure ✅

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-09
**Commit**: 6380bd469cfb1d76a8f9f7312dd2ff9cc1c6121f

**Solution Implemented**:
- Configured top-level Maven POM for multi-module build structure
- Centralized dependency management for all future modules (Checkstyle 11.0.1, PMD 7.17.0, TestNG 7.8.0, Requirements-Java 12.0, Maven plugin APIs)
- Standardized plugin versions and configuration
- Enabled build optimization with Maven build cache
- Defined ${project.root.basedir} property for config file paths to support sub-module references

**Configuration Improvements**:
- Inline version numbers for single-use dependencies (cleaner POM structure)
- Blank line separation between normal and test-scoped dependencies
- Removed non-standard ${maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory} (documented in out-of-scope.md)
- Removed blank line between <modelVersion> and <groupId> for consistency

**Files Modified**:
- `pom.xml` - Configured root POM with dependency management and quality gates
- `docs/project/scope/out-of-scope.md` - Documented removal of non-standard property

**Quality Gates**:
- ✅ BUILD SUCCESS
- ✅ Checkstyle: 0 violations
- ✅ PMD: 0 issues

**Scope**: Top-level POM only - sub-modules will be added as needed by subsequent tasks (A1-A4, B1, etc.)

**Next Steps**: Tasks A1-A4 are now unblocked and can be worked on in parallel
