# Verify task archival requirements after COMPLETE state

# Usage: bash .claude/hooks/verify-task-archival.sh [task-name]
#
# This script runs ONCE after COMPLETE state if archival was skipped.
# It verifies that a completed task has been properly archived:
# 1. Task REMOVED from todo.md (entire entry deleted)
# 2. Task ADDED to changelog.md (under today's date)
# 3. Both files staged for commit
#
# TRIGGER CONDITIONS:
# - Lock file exists with state="CLEANUP" (transitioning from COMPLETE)
# - Archival marker file does NOT exist
# - Task still present in todo.md (archival was skipped)

MESSAGE="## ❌ TASK ARCHIVAL VIOLATION

**Task**: \`$TASK_NAME\`
**State**: CLEANUP (archival should have occurred during COMPLETE state)
**Problem**: Task still exists in todo.md - archival was skipped

**Requirement**: Tasks must be DELETED from todo.md and ADDED to changelog.md during COMPLETE state

**Found at**:
$FOUND_AT

**Correct Archival Process (COMPLETE State)**:
1. DELETE entire task entry from todo.md
2. ADD task to changelog.md under ## $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
3. Commit both changes together with implementation in single atomic commit

**Recovery Steps**:
\`\`\`bash
# 1. Remove task from todo.md (delete entire entry)
# 2. Add task to changelog.md with completion details
# 3. Stage both files
git add todo.md changelog.md

# 4. Amend the COMPLETE commit to include archival
git commit --amend --no-edit
\`\`\`

See CLAUDE.md 'CRITICAL TASK ARCHIVAL' section for complete requirements.

**Note**: This verification runs once during CLEANUP state to catch missed archival."
