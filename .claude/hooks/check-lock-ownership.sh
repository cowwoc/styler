# - Checks if the corresponding lock file exists and is owned by this session
# - Shows "ACTIVE TASK DETECTED" warning only when both conditions are met
# - Exits silently when in main branch or outside worktree directories

  MESSAGE="## üö® CRITICAL: INVALID LOCK FILE DETECTED

**Your session_id found in INCORRECTLY-NAMED lock file(s)**:
$INVALID_LOCKS

**Problem**: Lock files MUST use \`.json\` extension (per task-protocol.md)

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS FILE IS INVALID AND WILL BE IGNORED BY ALL PROTOCOL SCRIPTS**

**Action Required**:
1. You do NOT own any valid task locks
2. Remove the invalid file: \`rm $INVALID_LOCKS\`
3. If you need to claim this task, follow proper protocol in task-protocol.md

**Why this matters**:
- The \`check-lock-ownership.sh\` hook ONLY checks \`*.json\` files
- No protocol script will recognize ownership from non-.json files
- Working on tasks without proper \`.json\` lock causes race conditions"

**Action Required**:
1. Continue from state: \`$TASK_STATE\`
2. Complete all remaining protocol phases
3. Only after Phase 7 (CLEANUP) may you select a new task

**CRITICAL - AUTONOMOUS COMPLETION REQUIREMENT**:
‚ö†Ô∏è  **DO NOT** pause mid-protocol to provide status updates
‚ö†Ô∏è  **DO NOT** ask user for permission to continue
‚ö†Ô∏è  **DO NOT** summarize progress instead of working

**REQUIRED BEHAVIOR**:
‚úÖ Use tools IMMEDIATELY to make progress
‚úÖ Continue working autonomously through all phases
‚úÖ Only stop for genuine external blockers (API down, missing credentials)

**DO NOT**:
- ‚ùå Select a new task from todo.md
- ‚ùå Work on any other task
- ‚ùå Delete or modify the lock file
- ‚ùå Assume this task is abandoned
- ‚ùå Provide status summaries without tool calls
- ‚ùå Ask \"would you like me to continue?\"
- ‚ùå Use task complexity/duration as excuse to pause"
