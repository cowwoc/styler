**Action Required**:
1. You do NOT own any valid task locks
2. Remove the invalid file: \`rm $INVALID_LOCKS\`

**Why this matters**:
- The \`check-lock-ownership.sh\` hook ONLY checks \`*.json\` files
- No protocol script will recognize ownership from non-.json files
- Working on tasks without proper \`.json\` lock causes race conditions"

**Lock File**: \`$LOCK_FILE\`
**Worktree**: \`$TASK_WORKTREE\`
**Commit Presented**: \`$COMMIT_SHA\`
**Approval Status**: \`$CHECKPOINT_APPROVED\`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL - MANDATORY USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINT

The implementation has been completed and changes have been committed.
**YOU ARE AT CHECKPOINT 2** - This state exists because:
1. All stakeholder agents returned ✅ APPROVED
2. Implementation commit was created with SHA: \`$COMMIT_SHA\`
3. Changes were presented to user for review
4. **WAITING FOR USER APPROVAL** before proceeding to merge

## 🔴 REQUIRED ACTION - DO NOT BYPASS

**You MUST:**
1. Navigate to task worktree: \`cd $TASK_WORKTREE\`
2. Show the commit to remind user: \`git show --stat $COMMIT_SHA\`
3. Show the diff: \`git diff ${COMMIT_SHA}~1 $COMMIT_SHA\`
4. Present implementation summary to user
5. **WAIT for explicit user approval** (\"Approved\", \"LGTM\", \"Proceed\")

**PROHIBITED:**
❌ Proceeding to COMPLETE state without user approval
❌ Assuming \"continue\" means approval
❌ Bypassing checkpoint because agent approvals exist
❌ Interpreting silence as approval
❌ Treating bypass mode as checkpoint override

## 🛑 ENFORCEMENT

This checkpoint is **MANDATORY REGARDLESS** of:
- Bypass mode settings
- Automation mode
- User instructions to \"continue\" or \"finish\"
- Previous context or conversation

**ONLY explicit approval words allow Phase 7 transition:**
✅ \"Approved\" / \"LGTM\" / \"Looks good\" / \"Proceed\" / \"Yes, merge it\"

## Navigation Commands

\`\`\`bash
cd $TASK_WORKTREE
git show --stat $COMMIT_SHA
git diff ${COMMIT_SHA}~1 $COMMIT_SHA

MESSAGE="## ⚠️ ACTIVE TASK DETECTED

**Task**: \`$TASK_NAME\`
**Current State**: \`$TASK_STATE\`
**Lock File**: \`$LOCK_FILE\`
**Worktree**: \`$TASK_WORKTREE\`
${APPROVAL_STATUS:+**Checkpoint Status**: \`$APPROVAL_STATUS\`}

🚨 **YOU MUST RESUME THIS TASK** before starting any new work.

## 🔴 FIRST: Navigate to Task Worktree

**Your current location**: \`$CURRENT_DIR\`

**YOU MUST RUN THIS COMMAND FIRST** (before ANY other operations):

\`\`\`bash
cd $TASK_WORKTREE
\`\`\`

**THEN verify your location**:

\`\`\`bash
pwd  # Should show: $TASK_WORKTREE
\`\`\`

**THEN check task status**:

\`\`\`bash
git status
\`\`\`

## Action Required After Navigation:

1. Continue from state: \`$TASK_STATE\`
2. Complete all remaining protocol phases
3. Only after Phase 8 (CLEANUP) may you select a new task

${APPROVAL_STATUS:+${APPROVAL_STATUS/NOT OBTAINED/## 🛑 MANDATORY USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINT #2

**YOU MUST STOP AFTER REVIEW** and present changes for user approval.

**CRITICAL**: Proceeding to COMPLETE state without user approval is a PROTOCOL VIOLATION.

**REQUIRED STEPS BEFORE COMPLETE**:
1. ✅ Commit all changes to task branch (if not already committed)
2. ✅ Record commit SHA: \`git rev-parse HEAD\`
3. ✅ Present to user:
   - Commit SHA for review
   - Files changed: \`git show --stat HEAD\`
   - Key implementation decisions
   - Test results (all passing)
   - Quality gates (checkstyle: PASS, PMD: PASS, build: SUCCESS)
4. ✅ Ask: \"Please review these changes. Would you like me to proceed with finalizing (COMPLETE → CLEANUP)?\"
5. ✅ WAIT for explicit approval keywords: \"yes\", \"approved\", \"LGTM\", \"proceed\", \"looks good\"

**ADD TODOWRITE CHECKPOINT TASK**:
\`\`\`
✅ Execute REVIEW phase - Stakeholder approval (completed)
⏸️ **Wait for user review and approval of changes** (in_progress) ← ADD THIS
⏸️ Execute COMPLETE phase - Merge to main (pending)
\`\`\`

**PROHIBITED ASSUMPTIONS**:
❌ \"Continue without asking\" instructions - DOES NOT skip checkpoint
❌ Bypass mode settings - DOES NOT skip checkpoint
❌ Stakeholder approval alone - DOES NOT equal user approval
❌ Silence or lack of objection - DOES NOT mean approval

**ENFORCEMENT**: \`enforce-user-approval.sh\` hook will BLOCK COMPLETE transition without approval marker}}

## CRITICAL - AUTONOMOUS COMPLETION REQUIREMENT:

⚠️  **DO NOT** pause mid-protocol to provide status updates
⚠️  **DO NOT** ask user for permission to continue
⚠️  **DO NOT** summarize progress instead of working

## REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:

✅ Use tools IMMEDIATELY to make progress
✅ Continue working autonomously through all phases
✅ Only stop for genuine external blockers (API down, missing credentials)

## PROHIBITED PATTERNS:

❌ Working on main branch while task worktree exists
❌ Checking \`git status\` on main when you have an active task
❌ Performing ANY operations before navigating to task worktree
❌ Select a new task from todo.md
❌ Delete or modify the lock file
❌ Assume this task is abandoned
❌ Ask \"would you like me to continue?\"
❌ Use task complexity/duration as excuse to pause"
