# VIOLATION: Completed SYNTHESIS but not in awaiting state
if [ "$SYNTHESIS_COMPLETE" = "true" ] && [ "$CURRENT_STATE" != "SYNTHESIS_AWAITING_APPROVAL" ]; then
  cat <<'SYNTHESIS_VIOLATION'

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VIOLATION: SYNTHESIS Checkpoint

You completed SYNTHESIS but did NOT transition to SYNTHESIS_AWAITING_APPROVAL state.

**MANDATORY STATE TRANSITION:**
After presenting the implementation plan, you MUST update the lock file state:

```bash
jq '.state = "SYNTHESIS_AWAITING_APPROVAL"' /workspace/locks/implement-security-controls.json > /tmp/lock.json && mv /tmp/lock.json /workspace/locks/implement-security-controls.json
```

**CORRECT WORKFLOW:**
1. Complete SYNTHESIS (consolidate requirements into plan)
2. Present implementation plan to user in markdown format
3. **Update lock file state to SYNTHESIS_AWAITING_APPROVAL**
4. **STOP and wait for user response**
5. User approves â†’ Update state to CONTEXT and proceed
6. User rejects â†’ Update state back to SYNTHESIS and revise

**YOU MUST STOP NOW** - Update lock state and wait for user approval.

# VIOLATION: Trying to proceed to implementation without approval
if [ "$PROCEEDING_TO_IMPL" = "true" ] && [ "$CURRENT_STATE" != "CONTEXT" ]; then
  cat <<IMPL_WITHOUT_APPROVAL

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VIOLATION: Proceeding Without User Approval

You are trying to proceed to CONTEXT/IMPLEMENTATION but lock file state is: $CURRENT_STATE

**Required state for implementation**: CONTEXT
**Current state**: $CURRENT_STATE

**If you just presented a plan:**
1. Update lock state to SYNTHESIS_AWAITING_APPROVAL
2. STOP and wait for user approval

**If user approved:**
1. Update lock state to CONTEXT
2. Then proceed with implementation

**NEVER proceed to implementation without:**
- Lock file state = CONTEXT
- User explicitly approving the plan

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VIOLATION: REVIEW Checkpoint

You achieved unanimous stakeholder approval but did NOT:
1. Create git commit
2. Update lock file state to REVIEW_AWAITING_APPROVAL

**MANDATORY ACTIONS:**

1. **Create implementation commit:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Implementation message..."
   git show --stat
   ```

2. **Update lock file state:**
   ```bash
   jq '.state = "REVIEW_AWAITING_APPROVAL"' /workspace/locks/implement-security-controls.json > /tmp/lock.json && mv /tmp/lock.json /workspace/locks/implement-security-controls.json
   ```

3. **Present to user and STOP**

**CORRECT WORKFLOW:**
1. Achieve unanimous approval âœ… (you are here)
2. Create commit + update state to REVIEW_AWAITING_APPROVAL
3. STOP and wait for user
4. User approves â†’ Update state to COMPLETE and proceed
5. User rejects â†’ Update state back to CONVERGENCE and revise

  cat <<COMPLETE_WITHOUT_APPROVAL

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VIOLATION: Proceeding to COMPLETE Without Approval

Lock file state is: $CURRENT_STATE (must be COMPLETE to proceed)

**If you just created a commit:**
1. Update lock state to REVIEW_AWAITING_APPROVAL
2. STOP and wait for user approval

**If user approved:**
1. Update lock state to COMPLETE
2. Then proceed with merge/cleanup
