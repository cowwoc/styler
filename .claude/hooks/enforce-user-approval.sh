## üö® MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: Create Commit for User Review

You have achieved unanimous stakeholder approval. Before proceeding, you MUST:

1. **Create implementation commit** with all changes:
   ```bash
   # Stage all modified files
   git add -A

   # Create commit with comprehensive message (see CLAUDE.md ¬ß Checkpoint 2)
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   [Task name]: [Brief summary]

   [Detailed implementation description]

   Changes:
   - [Major changes]
   - [File modifications]
   - [Test coverage]

   Stakeholder Approvals:
   - Technical Architect: ‚úÖ APPROVED
   - Security Auditor: ‚úÖ APPROVED
   - Code Quality Auditor: ‚úÖ APPROVED
   - Performance Analyzer: ‚úÖ APPROVED
   - Style Auditor: ‚úÖ APPROVED

   Test Results: [X/X passing]

   # Show commit summary
   git show --stat

   # Show detailed diff
   git diff HEAD~1
   ```

2. **Present commit to user:**
   ```
   ## Implementation Complete - Ready for Review

   I have completed the [task-name] implementation with unanimous stakeholder approval.

   **Stakeholder Reviews:** [5/5 approved]
   **Test Results:** [X tests passing]
   **Files Modified:** [list key files]

   **Commit Created:** [commit hash]

   Please review the changes above. Reply with:
   - "Approved" or "LGTM" to proceed with merge to main
   - "Rejected" or specific feedback to make revisions
   ```

3. **Wait for explicit user approval** before Phase 7 (COMPLETE)

**DO NOT:**
- ‚ùå Say "awaiting approval" without showing what you're asking approval FOR
- ‚ùå Proceed to Phase 7 without user approval message
- ‚ùå Skip commit creation

**CORRECT SEQUENCE:**
1. Achieve unanimous stakeholder approval ‚úÖ (you are here)
2. Create commit and show changes ‚è≥ (DO THIS NOW)
3. Present to user and wait for approval ‚è≥ (THEN THIS)
4. Only after user approves: proceed to Phase 7 ‚è≥

**Pattern to follow:** See CLAUDE.md ¬ß "PHASE 6 ‚Üí USER APPROVAL ‚Üí PHASE 7 EXAMPLE" for the exact correct pattern.
