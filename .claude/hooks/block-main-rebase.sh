🚨 REBASE ON MAIN BLOCKED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ Attempted: git rebase on main branch
✅ Correct:   Main branch should never be rebased

WHY THIS IS BLOCKED:
• Rebasing main rewrites commit history
• Merged commits get recreated as direct commits
• This breaks the audit trail and disrupts collaboration

WHAT TO DO INSTEAD:
• If you need to fix a commit message: Use git commit --amend on a feature
  branch BEFORE merging to main
• If already merged: The history is final. Accept it or create a new commit
• For commit reordering: Do this on feature branches, not main

CORRECT WORKFLOW:
1. All changes on feature branch
2. Squash/rebase on feature branch (before merge)
3. Merge to main with --ff-only
4. Never rebase main

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
❌ COMMAND BLOCKED - Rebase on main is prohibited
EOF
	output_hook_block "Blocked: git rebase on main branch is prohibited. Rebase rewrites history and breaks audit trail."
	exit 0
fi

# Allow rebase on non-main branches
echo '{}'
exit 0
