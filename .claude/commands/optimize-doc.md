  Optimize documentation using two-agent workflow: optimizer removes redundancy, independent validator
  verifies preservation of critical content

# Optimize Documentation Command

**Task**: Optimize the documentation file: `{{arg}}`

**Two-Agent Workflow**:
1. **Optimizer Agent** (you): Strengthen instructions, remove redundancy, apply conciseness strategies
2. **Validator Agent** (independent): Verify no meaning loss, vagueness, or execution ability reduction

## ⚠️ BASH COMMAND EXECUTION REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL**: Bash commands in this document that use parameter expansion like `${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}` will fail with parse errors when executed directly via the Bash tool.

**Required Pattern** (use for ALL bash blocks containing `##` parameter expansion):

```bash
# ❌ FAILS: Direct execution
BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"
# Error: (eval):1: parse error near `('

# ✅ CORRECT: Execute via script file
cat > /tmp/script-name.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"
# ... rest of commands
EOF
bash /tmp/script-name.sh
```

**Apply this pattern to these sections**:
- Step 6: Self-review rollback
- Step 7: Phase 1 candidate creation
- Step 7: Store agent ID
- Step 7: Phase 1 checkpoint
- Step 7: Phase 2 baseline creation
- Step 7B: Iterative refinement rollback
- Step 8: Remove backup

## 🚨 DOCUMENT TYPE VALIDATION

**Optimizes ONLY Claude-facing documentation. Refuse human-facing documents.**

### Claude-Facing Documents (ALLOWED)
- `.claude/` configuration files (agents, commands, hooks, settings)
- `CLAUDE.md` and project instructions for Claude
- `docs/project/` development protocol documentation (task-protocol-*, agent-*, *-guide.md)
- `docs/code-style/*-claude.md` style detection patterns for Claude

### Human-Facing Documents (FORBIDDEN)
- `README.md` files (user-facing project documentation)
- `changelog.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (user-facing release notes)
- `docs/studies/` research and analysis documents
- `docs/decisions/` historical decision records
- `docs/performance/` performance documentation
- `docs/optional-modules/` potentially user-facing guides
- `todo.md` (working task list)
- `docs/code-style/*-human.md` human explanations
- Any documentation in project root intended for human developers

### Validation Procedure

**BEFORE optimizing, check the file path:**

1. **If path matches forbidden patterns, REFUSE**:
   ```
   This command only optimizes Claude-facing documentation.

   The file `{{arg}}` appears to be human-facing documentation (README, changelog, studies, etc.).
   ```

2. **If path matches allowed patterns, PROCEED** with optimization

**Detection Patterns**:
- FORBIDDEN: `**/README.md`, `**/changelog.md`, `**/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/studies/**`, `docs/decisions/**`, `docs/performance/**`, `docs/optional-modules/**`, `todo.md`, `**/*-human.md`
- ALLOWED: `.claude/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/project/task-protocol-*`, `docs/project/agent-*`, `docs/project/*-guide.md`, `docs/code-style/*-claude.md`

## Objective

Make documentation more concise and clear without introducing vagueness.

**Optimization Goals** (in priority order):
1. **Eliminate vagueness**: Strengthen instructions with explicit criteria and measurable steps
2. **Increase conciseness**: Remove redundancy while preserving all necessary information
3. **Preserve clarity AND meaning**: Never sacrifice understanding or semantic accuracy for brevity

**Idempotent Design**: Multiple runs on same document:
- **First pass**: Strengthen vague instructions, remove obvious redundancy
- **Second/subsequent passes**: Further optimization or no changes if optimal

## Analysis Methodology

For each instruction section in the document:

### Step 1: Distinguish Instructions from Examples (DO THIS FIRST)

**First, identify INSTRUCTION vs EXAMPLE:**

**INSTRUCTION** (NEVER remove):
- Commands to execute: `grep -i "keywords" file.md`
- Questions to ask: "Ask: 'Is there an imported data sheet?'"
- Specific actions: "Close Excel, wait 2 seconds, retry"
- Conditions to check: "If grep returns results → do X"

**EXAMPLE** (May remove if instruction clear):
- Demonstrations of the instruction: "For example: grep -i 'foo'"
- Sample outputs: "You should see: [output]"
- Illustrative scenarios: "Like this: [scenario]"

**Test**: Would removing this eliminate a concrete action/command/check?
- YES → It's an INSTRUCTION, keep it
- NO → It's an EXAMPLE, evaluate per Step 2

**Common mistake to avoid:**
❌ WRONG: Treating "grep -i 'keywords' file.md" as an example of grepping
✅ RIGHT: Recognizing this IS the instruction (what command to run)

### Step 2: Evaluate for Vagueness/Ambiguity

**Is the instruction clear WITHOUT the examples?**

Cover the examples and read ONLY the instruction. Then apply these tests:

**Clarity Tests** (ALL must pass):
1. **Completeness**: Are all parameters/inputs specified?
   - ❌ FAIL: "Check grep" (which grep command? which file?)
   - ✅ PASS: "Run `grep -i 'keywords' file.md`"

2. **Unambiguous**: Could this be interpreted in only ONE way?
   - ❌ FAIL: "Fix if possible" (what determines possible?)
   - ✅ PASS: "Fix if deterministic (formula bug, wrong reference)"

3. **Self-sufficient**: Can Claude execute without guessing or inferring?
   - ❌ FAIL: "Use the script" (which script? what parameters?)
   - ✅ PASS: "Use `claude/scripts/recalculate_excel.ps1 workbook.xlsx`"

4. **Preserved context**: Is when/why to apply this clear?
   - ❌ FAIL: "Import first" (import what? when?)
   - ✅ PASS: "Before creating ACB schedule: Import transaction data to separate sheet"

**Decision Tree**:
```
ALL 4 tests pass?
├─ YES → Instruction is CLEAR → Proceed to Step 3 (may remove examples)
└─ NO → Instruction is VAGUE → Proceed to Step 4 (strengthen instruction)
```

**If ANY test fails, the instruction is VAGUE.**

### Step 3: If Clear (Examples Not Needed for Understanding)

**Proceed only if instruction is clear without examples.**

1. Identify examples following the instruction
2. **Apply Execution Test**: Can Claude execute correctly without this example?
   - If NO (example defines ambiguous term) → **KEEP**
   - If YES → Determine if examples serve operational purpose:
   - ✅ Defines what "correct" looks like → **KEEP**
   - ✅ Shows exact commands with success criteria → **KEEP**
   - ✅ Sequential workflows where order matters → **KEEP**
   - ✅ Resolves ambiguity in instruction wording → **KEEP**
   - ✅ Data structures (JSON formats) → **KEEP**
   - ❌ Explains WHY (educational/rationale) → **REMOVE**
   - ❌ Only restates already-clear instruction → **REMOVE**

### Step 4: If Vague (Examples Needed for Understanding)

**DO NOT REMOVE EXAMPLES YET - Strengthen instruction first.**

1. Identify the source of vagueness:
   - Subjective terms without definition
   - Missing criteria or measurements
   - Unclear boundaries or edge cases
   - Narrative description instead of explicit steps

2. Strengthen the instruction:
   - Replace subjective terms with explicit criteria
   - Convert narrative to numbered steps
   - Add measurable thresholds or boundaries
   - Define what "success" looks like

3. **KEEP all examples** - They're needed until instruction is strengthened

4. **Mark for next pass**: After strengthening, examples can be re-evaluated in next optimization pass

## Categories of Examples to KEEP (Even with Clear Instructions)

1. **Executable Commands**: Bash scripts, jq commands, git workflows
2. **Data Structures**: JSON formats, configuration schemas, API contracts
3. **Boundary Demonstrations**: Prohibited vs permitted patterns, edge cases
4. **Concept Illustrations**: Examples that show what a vague term means (e.g., "contextual" JavaDoc)
5. **Templates**: Reusable formats for structured responses
6. **Prevention Examples**: Wrong vs right patterns for frequently violated rules
7. **Pattern Extraction Rules**: Annotations that generalize examples into reusable decision principles

## 🚨 ADDITIONAL PROTECTED CONTENT TYPES

### 1. Content Specification Instructions (NEVER REMOVE)

**Instructions that specify what content to include in outputs are OPERATIONAL, not explanatory.**

**Examples**:
- "Reference the mistake that prompted the update" ← Specifies required content
- "Include brief history of what problems patterns prevent" ← Specifies required content
- "Document context for why specific patterns were added" ← Specifies required content
- "Add inline comments explaining pattern evolution" ← Specifies required content

**Test**: Does this instruction tell the agent what content to produce/include?
- YES → It's a content specification, KEEP IT
- NO → It may be condensable

**Common Mistake**:
❌ WRONG: Treating "Reference the mistake" as explanatory context
✅ RIGHT: Recognizing this specifies required output content

### 2. Methodology Guidance (PRESERVE PEDAGOGICAL VALUE)

**Sub-bullets that show HOW to execute are different from sub-bullets that list WHAT to collect.**

**Methodology Guidance** (shows process/method):
- Questions that guide thinking: "Was the correct path documented?"
- First step instructions: "Read the agent's invocation prompt"
- Process steps: "Check what files they had access to"
- Diagnostic questions: "Was guidance not prominent enough?"

**Simple Lists** (just enumerates items):
- "Agent prompt, files accessed, missing context" ← Just a list
- No guidance about process or methodology

**Test**: Does this show HOW to think about or approach the task?
- YES → It's methodology guidance, preserve pedagogical value
- NO → It's just a list, may be condensable

**Example**:

❌ **TOO AGGRESSIVE** (loses methodology):
```markdown
Before:
**What information was available to the agent?**
- Read the agent's invocation prompt  ← First step
- Check what files they had access to  ← Second step
- Identify what context was missing    ← Third step

After (LOSES PROCESS):
**Available Information**: Agent prompt, files accessed, missing context
^^^ Lost: The sequential process of HOW to investigate
```

✅ **BETTER** (preserves methodology):
```markdown
Before:
**What information was available to the agent?**
- Read the agent's invocation prompt
- Check what files they had access to
- Identify what context was missing

After (ACCEPTABLE):
**Available Information** (read prompt, check file access, identify gaps):
Agent prompt, files accessed, missing context
^^^ Preserved: The process in parenthetical guidance
```

✅ **BEST** (keeps sub-bullets when they show process):
```markdown
**Available Information**:
1. Read the agent's invocation prompt
2. Check what files they had access to
3. Identify what context was missing
^^^ Preserved: Clear sequential process
```

### 3. Sequencing and Ordering Information (NEVER REMOVE)

**Temporal ordering and prerequisites are execution-critical.**

**Sequencing Indicators** (ALWAYS PRESERVE):
- "Once basic test passes, test variations" ← Sequence: do X, THEN Y
- "Before doing X, verify Y" ← Prerequisite
- "After applying fixes, attempt reproduction" ← Order dependency
- "First... then... finally..." ← Explicit sequence
- "Step 1... Step 2... Step 3..." ← Numbered workflow

**Test**: Does this specify WHEN to do something relative to other steps?
- YES → It's sequencing information, KEEP IT
- NO → May be condensable

**Examples**:

❌ **WRONG** (loses sequencing):
```markdown
Before:
8. **Test Edge Cases**:
   Once basic reproduction test passes, test variations:
   ^^^ WHEN to do this
   - Different agents encountering same scenario
   - Slight variations of the mistake pattern

After (LOSES TIMING):
8. **Edge Cases**: Test variations, different agents
^^^ Lost: Do this AFTER basic test passes
```

✅ **CORRECT** (preserves sequencing):
```markdown
After:
8. **Edge Cases** (after basic test passes): Test variations, different agents
^^^ Preserved: Temporal ordering
```

### 4. Checklist Item Distinctness (PRESERVE UNIQUE CRITERIA)

**Each checklist item should represent a distinct validation criterion.**

**Before Merging/Removing Checklist Items, Verify**:
1. Is this criterion covered by another item?
   - "Concrete examples" vs "Examples are concrete" → Same criterion
   - "Aligns with project conventions" vs "Matches existing format" → Different criteria
2. Does removing this lose a validation angle?
3. Can the remaining items fully cover this check?

**Example**:

⚠️ **QUESTIONABLE** (may lose coverage):
```markdown
Before:
- [ ] No conflicts with other agent configs
- [ ] Aligns with project conventions  ← Broader than just format
- [ ] Terminology is consistent
- [ ] Format matches existing sections

After (POTENTIALLY INCOMPLETE):
- [ ] No conflicts with other configs
- [ ] Consistent terminology
- [ ] Matches existing format
^^^ Lost: "Aligns with project conventions" is broader than format matching
```

✅ **BETTER** (preserves all criteria):
```markdown
After:
- [ ] No conflicts with other configs
- [ ] Aligns with conventions (terminology, format, structure)
^^^ Preserved: Broader convention alignment concept
```

## Categories of Examples to REMOVE

1. **Redundant Clarification**: Examples that restate the instruction in different words
2. **Obvious Applications**: Examples showing trivial applications of clear rules
3. **Duplicate Templates**: Multiple versions of the same template
4. **Verbose Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step narratives when numbered instructions exist

## 🚨 EXECUTION-CRITICAL CONTENT (NEVER CONDENSE)

Content types necessary for correct execution:

### 1. **Concrete Examples Defining "Correct"**
- Examples showing EXACT correct vs incorrect patterns when instruction uses abstract terms
- Specific file paths, line numbers, or command outputs showing what success looks like
- **Test**: Does the example define something ambiguous in the instruction?

**KEEP when instruction says "delete" but example shows this means "remove entire entry, not mark complete"**:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Marking complete in todo.md
vim todo.md  # Changed - [ ] to - [x]

# ✅ CORRECT: Delete from todo.md, add to changelog.md
vim todo.md  # DELETE entire task entry
vim changelog.md  # ADD under ## 2025-10-08
```

**REMOVE if instruction explicitly says "remove entire entry"**.

### 2. **Sequential Steps for State Machines**
- Numbered workflows where order matters for correctness
- State transition sequences where skipping/reordering causes failures
- **Test**: Can steps be executed in different order and still work?

**KEEP numbered sequence** when order is mandatory:
```
1. Complete SYNTHESIS phase
2. Present plan to user
3. Update lock: `jq '.state = "SYNTHESIS_AWAITING_APPROVAL"'`
4. STOP - wait for user
5. On approval: Update lock to `CONTEXT` and proceed
```

**REMOVE numbering** if steps are independent.

### 3. **Inline Comments That Specify WHAT to Verify**
- Comments explaining what output to expect or check
- Annotations specifying exact conditions for success/failure
- **Test**: Does comment specify success criteria not in the instruction?

**KEEP comments specifying criteria**:
```bash
# Before rewriting: git rev-list --count HEAD
# After rewriting: git rev-list --count HEAD
# Compare counts - should match unless you explicitly intended to drop commits
```

**REMOVE comments explaining WHY** (e.g., "This prevents data loss because..." - educational, not operational).

### 4. **Disambiguation Examples**
- Multiple examples showing boundary between prohibited/permitted when rule uses subjective terms
- Examples that resolve ambiguity in instruction wording
- **Test**: Can the instruction be misinterpreted without this example?

**KEEP** examples clarifying ambiguous instructions. **REMOVE** examples restating clear instructions.

### 5. **Pattern Extraction Rules**
- Annotations that generalize specific examples into reusable decision principles
- Text that teaches how to apply the same reasoning to future cases
- **Test**: Does this text extract a general rule from a specific example?

**KEEP pattern extraction annotations**:
```
[Specific example code block]
→ Shows that "delete" means remove lines, not change checkbox.
```
The arrow extracts the general principle (what "delete" means) from the specific example.

**REMOVE pure commentary**:
```
[Example code block]
→ This is a good practice to follow.
```
Generic praise without extracting a reusable decision rule.

**Critical Distinction**:
- ✅ **KEEP**: "→ Specifies exactly what success looks like" (teaches pattern recognition)
- ❌ **REMOVE**: "This example helps you understand the concept" (generic educational)
- ✅ **KEEP**: "→ Claude doesn't need to know why" (generalizes when to remove content)
- ❌ **REMOVE**: "This is important because it prevents errors" (explains WHY, not WHAT)

**Test**: If removed, would Claude lose ability to apply this reasoning to new examples? If YES → KEEP (pattern extraction, not commentary).

## 🚨 REFERENCE-BASED CONDENSING RULES

**When consolidating duplicate content via references:**

### ❌ NEVER Replace with References

1. **Content within sequential workflows** (Steps 1→2→3)
   - Jumping mid-workflow breaks execution flow
   - Keep operational content inline even if duplicated elsewhere

2. **Quick-reference lists in methodology sections**
   - Simple scannable lists serve different purpose than detailed explanations
   - Both can coexist: brief list for scanning, detailed section for depth

3. **Success criteria at decision points**
   - Content needed AT THE MOMENT of decision must be inline
   - Don't force jumping to verify each criterion

### ✅ OK to Replace with References

1. **Explanatory content that appears in multiple places**
   - Rationale sections
   - Background information
   - Historical context

2. **Content at document boundaries** (intro/conclusion)
   - References acceptable when introducing/summarizing
   - User not mid-execution at these points

3. **Cross-referencing related but distinct concepts**
   - "See also" style references
   - Not replacing direct duplication

### 🔍 Semantic Equivalence Test

**Before replacing content with reference, verify:**

1. **Same information**: Referenced section contains EXACT same information
   - ❌ WRONG: Replace "Goals: A, B, C" with reference to "Priority: C > B > A"
   - ✅ RIGHT: Replace duplicate "Goals: A, B, C" with reference to other "Goals: A, B, C"

2. **Same context**: Referenced section serves same purpose
   - ❌ WRONG: Replace "do X" with reference to "when to do X"
   - ✅ RIGHT: Replace "do X" with reference to "do X"

3. **Same level of detail**: No precision lost in referenced content
   - ❌ WRONG: Replace 7-item checklist with reference to 3-item summary
   - ✅ RIGHT: Replace 7-item checklist with reference to same 7-item checklist

### 📋 Duplication Taxonomy

**Type 1: Quick-Reference + Detailed** (KEEP BOTH)
- Simple list (3-5 words per item) for fast scanning
- Detailed section with tests, examples, edge cases
- **Purpose**: Different use cases - quick lookup vs deep understanding

**Type 2: Exact Duplication** (CONSOLIDATE)
- Same information, same level of detail, same context
- Appearing in multiple places with no contextual justification
- **Purpose**: Genuine redundancy - consolidate to single source

**Type 3: Pedagogical Repetition** (CONTEXT-DEPENDENT)
- Key rules stated multiple times for emphasis
- Summary + detailed explanation
- **Purpose**: Learning/retention - keep if document is pedagogical, remove if reference doc

### 🔍 Pre-Consolidation Verification

**Before removing ANY content for consolidation:**

1. ✅ Content is byte-for-byte duplicate OR semantically equivalent
2. ✅ Replacement reference doesn't interrupt sequential workflow
3. ✅ Referenced section is same level of detail
4. ✅ Consolidation doesn't remove quick-reference value
5. ✅ Verify by test: Can user execute task with reference-based version as easily as inline version?

**If ANY check fails → Keep duplicate inline**

## 🚨 DECISION RULE: The Execution Test

**Before removing ANY content, ask ALL questions in sequence:**

1. **Can Claude execute the instruction CORRECTLY without this content?**
   - If NO → KEEP (execution-critical)
   - If YES → Proceed to question 2

2. **Does this specify what CONTENT to include in outputs?** (NEW)
   - Examples: "Reference the mistake", "Include brief history", "Document context"
   - If YES → KEEP (content specification instruction)
   - If NO → Proceed to question 3

3. **Does this show HOW to execute (methodology), not just WHAT to collect?** (NEW)
   - Examples: First step instructions, diagnostic questions, process guidance
   - If YES → KEEP (methodology guidance) OR preserve in parenthetical
   - If NO → Proceed to question 4

4. **Does this specify WHEN to do something (sequencing/ordering)?** (NEW)
   - Examples: "Once X passes, do Y", "Before doing X", "After applying fixes"
   - If YES → KEEP (temporal ordering)
   - If NO → Proceed to question 5

5. **Is this a distinct checklist criterion not covered by other items?** (NEW)
   - Check: Does removing this lose a unique validation angle?
   - If YES → KEEP (distinct criterion)
   - If NO → Proceed to question 6

6. **Does this content explain WHY (rationale/educational)?**
   - If YES → REMOVE (not needed for execution)
   - If NO → KEEP (operational detail)

7. **Does this content show WHAT "correct" looks like (success criteria)?**
   - If YES → KEEP (execution-critical)
   - If NO → Proceed to question 8

8. **Does this content extract a general decision rule from a specific example?**
   - If YES → KEEP (pattern extraction for future cases)
   - If NO → May remove if redundant

**Critical**: Questions 2-5 are NEW protections added to prevent loss of operational instructions, methodology, sequencing, and distinct validation criteria.

### Examples Applying the Test

**REMOVE THIS** (explains WHY):
```
**RATIONALE**: Git history rewriting can silently drop commits or changes,
especially during interactive rebases where "pick" lines might be accidentally
deleted or conflicts might be resolved incorrectly. Manual verification is the
only reliable way to ensure no data loss occurred.
```
→ Claude doesn't need to know why; just needs to know to verify.

**KEEP THIS** (defines WHAT "correct" means):
```
**ARCHIVAL SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- `git diff todo.md` shows ONLY deletions
- `git diff changelog.md` shows ONLY additions under today's date
- Both files in SAME commit
- `grep task-name todo.md` returns no matches
```
→ Specifies exactly what success looks like; needed for correct execution.

**REMOVE THIS** (restates clear instruction):
```
When lock acquisition fails, you should not delete the lock file.
Instead, select an alternative task to work on.
```
→ If instruction already says "If lock acquisition fails: Select alternative task, do NOT delete lock"

**KEEP THIS** (resolves ambiguity in "delete"):
```bash
# ❌ WRONG: Marking complete in todo.md
vim todo.md  # Changed - [ ] to - [x]

# ✅ CORRECT: Delete from todo.md
vim todo.md  # DELETE entire task entry
```
→ Shows that "delete" means remove lines, not change checkbox.

### Examples Applying NEW Tests (Questions 2-5)

**KEEP THIS** (Question 2: Content specification):
```markdown
3. **Draft Update**:
   - Write clear, specific guidance
   - Include concrete examples (✅ vs ❌)
   - Reference the mistake that prompted the update  ← CONTENT SPECIFICATION
   - Add validation steps
```
→ "Reference the mistake" specifies required output content, not just explanation.

**KEEP THIS** (Question 3: Methodology guidance):
```markdown
**What information was available to the agent?**
- Read the agent's invocation prompt     ← First step (HOW)
- Check what files they had access to    ← Second step (HOW)
- Identify what context was missing      ← Third step (HOW)
```
→ Sub-bullets show sequential process, not just list of items.

**ACCEPTABLE CONDENSATION** (Question 3: Methodology preserved in parenthetical):
```markdown
**Available Information** (read prompt, check file access, identify gaps):
Agent prompt, files accessed, missing context
```
→ Process guidance preserved in parenthetical form.

**KEEP THIS** (Question 4: Sequencing information):
```markdown
8. **Test Edge Cases**:
   Once basic reproduction test passes, test variations:
   ^^^ WHEN to do this (temporal ordering)
```
→ Specifies to do edge cases AFTER basic test passes.

**KEEP THIS** (Question 5: Distinct checklist criterion):
```markdown
Validation Checklist:
- [ ] No conflicts with other agent configs
- [ ] Aligns with project conventions  ← Broader than just format
- [ ] Terminology is consistent
- [ ] Format matches existing sections
```
→ "Aligns with project conventions" is distinct from and broader than "Format matches".

## 🚨 CONCISENESS vs CORRECTNESS HIERARCHY

**Priority order** when deciding optimizations:

1. **CORRECTNESS** (highest priority)
   - Can Claude execute the instruction correctly without this?
   - Does this resolve ambiguity that would cause wrong execution?

2. **EFFICIENCY** (medium priority)
   - Does removing this make instructions faster to scan?
   - Does condensing reduce cognitive load?

3. **CONCISENESS** (lowest priority)
   - Does this reduce line count?
   - Does this tighten prose?

**Rule**: Correctness always takes priority over conciseness.

## Conciseness Strategies

**Techniques for concise instructions:**

1. **Eliminate Redundancy**:
   - Remove repeated information across sections
   - Consolidate overlapping instructions
   - Replace verbose phrases with precise terms

2. **Tighten Language**:
   - Replace "you MUST execute" with "execute"
   - Replace "in order to" with "to"
   - Remove filler words ("clearly", "obviously", "simply")

3. **Use Structure Over Prose**:
   - Convert narrative paragraphs to bulleted lists
   - Use numbered steps for sequential processes
   - Use tables for multi-dimensional information

4. **Preserve Essential Elements**:
   - Keep all executable commands (bash, jq)
   - Keep all data structure formats (JSON)
   - Keep all boundary demonstrations (wrong vs right)
   - Keep all measurable criteria and success definitions

**Never sacrifice for conciseness:**
- **Semantic metadata headers**: Labels like "**TARGET AUDIENCE**:", "**OUTPUT FORMAT**:", "**INPUT REQUIREMENT**:" provide explicit categorization and scannability
- **Scannability**: Vertical lists are clearer than comma-separated concatenations
- **Pattern recognition**: Checkmarks/bullets for required actions are clearer than prose
- Explicit criteria ("ALL", "at least ONE", "NEVER")
- Measurable thresholds (counts, file paths, exact strings)
- Prevention patterns (prohibited vs required)
- Error condition definitions

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- ❌ Removing semantic metadata headers: "**TARGET AUDIENCE**: Claude AI" → "Claude AI" (loses explicit categorization)
- ❌ Converting vertical list of prohibited phrases to slash-separated concatenation
- ❌ Converting checkmarked action items (✅) to comma-separated prose
- ❌ Removing section headers that aid navigation
- ❌ Consolidating distinct concepts into single run-on sentences
- ❌ Replacing inline workflow criteria with "see section X" mid-execution
- ❌ Replacing "Goals: A, B, C" with reference to "Priority: C > B > A" (not semantically equivalent)
- ❌ Removing quick-reference lists because detailed section exists elsewhere

## Redundancy Taxonomy (Formalized)

Systematic classification of redundant content. Each category: Pattern, Detection, Fix, Clarity Impact.

### Category 1: Narrative Redundancy
**Pattern**: Instruction followed by explanation restating the same information

**Detection**: Statement → "This means..." → Restatement. Trigger phrases: "In other words", "That is to say". Second sentence adds no information.

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ REDUNDANT:
"Execute the validation script before committing. This means that you must
run the script prior to making a commit. In other words, always validate first."
→ 3 sentences saying same thing

✅ CONDENSED:
"Execute the validation script before committing."
→ Single clear instruction
```

**Fix**: Remove explanation, keep instruction
**Clarity Impact**: None

### Category 2: Example Redundancy
**Pattern**: Multiple examples demonstrating identical principle without added value

**Detection**: 3+ code blocks showing same concept with trivial variations. Examples differ only in names, not behavior. No boundary demonstration.

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ REDUNDANT (3 examples of same thing):
Example 1: `git status` shows changes
Example 2: `git status` displays modifications
Example 3: `git status` lists uncommitted files
→ All three show: git status reveals uncommitted work

✅ CONDENSED (1 example sufficient):
Example: `git status` shows uncommitted changes
```

**Fix**: Keep 1-2 best examples showing range, remove redundant instances
**Clarity Impact**: Verify via Execution Test

### Category 3: Definition Redundancy
**Pattern**: Term defined multiple times in different sections

**Detection**: Same term defined in multiple places. Definitions semantically equivalent. No reference between definitions.

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ REDUNDANT:
Section A: "OPTIMAL: Complete, maintainable, follows best practices"
Section B: "OPTIMAL solution means: Complete implementation, maintainable code, best practices"
→ Same definition in two sections

✅ CONSOLIDATED:
Section A: "OPTIMAL: Complete, maintainable, follows best practices"
Section B: "Use OPTIMAL solution (see terminology definition)"
→ Define once, reference elsewhere
```

**Fix**: Keep definition in primary location, replace others with reference
**Clarity Impact**: Only if reference doesn't interrupt workflow

### Category 4: Procedural Redundancy
**Pattern**: Same procedure described in multiple places with equivalent steps

**Detection**: Identical step sequences in different sections. Same commands, rephrased. No contextual difference justifying duplication.

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ REDUNDANT:
Section "Validation":
1. Run checkstyle
2. Fix violations
3. Re-run to verify

Section "Quality Gates":
1. Execute checkstyle
2. Address violations
3. Verify all pass
→ Same 3-step procedure, different wording

✅ CONSOLIDATED:
Section "Validation": [Full procedure]
Section "Quality Gates": "Follow validation procedure (see Validation section)"
```

**Fix**: Keep detailed procedure in one place, reference from others
**Clarity Impact**: Safe at section boundary, unsafe mid-execution

### Category 5: Rationale Redundancy (ALWAYS REMOVABLE)
**Pattern**: Explanations of WHY something is required (educational content)

**Detection**: Paragraphs starting "This is because...", "The reason is...". Describes benefits/context. Doesn't specify WHAT or HOW.

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ REDUNDANT (explanatory):
"Verify commit count before and after rebase.

RATIONALE: Git history rewriting can silently drop commits, especially during
interactive rebases where lines might be deleted. Manual verification is the
only reliable way to ensure no data loss."
→ Instruction + WHY explanation

✅ CONDENSED (operational only):
"Verify commit count before and after rebase:
  # Before: git rev-list --count HEAD
  # After: git rev-list --count HEAD
  # Should match unless you intended to drop commits"
→ Instruction + WHAT to check
```

**Fix**: Remove RATIONALE sections, keep instruction + success criteria
**Clarity Impact**: None

### Category 6: Pedagogical Redundancy (CONTEXT-DEPENDENT)
**Pattern**: Key rules stated multiple times for emphasis or learning

**Detection**: Same rule in summary, header, and body. Repetition serves learning, not execution. Common in tutorials.

**Examples**:
```markdown
❌ REDUNDANT (pedagogical emphasis):
Summary: "Never commit without testing"
Section: "Pre-Commit Requirements: Never commit without testing"
Instruction: "Before committing, run tests (never commit without testing)"
→ Rule stated 3 times for emphasis

✅ FOR REFERENCE DOC (condensed):
Summary: "Testing required before commits"
Section: "Pre-Commit Requirements"
Instruction: "Before committing, run tests"
→ Rule stated once per context

✅ FOR TUTORIAL (keep repetition):
[Same as redundant example - repetition aids learning]
```

**Fix**: Remove in reference docs, keep in tutorials
**Clarity Impact**: None for reference docs, harmful removal in tutorials

### Detection Decision Tree

```
Found repeated content?
├─ Same instruction in multiple places?
│  ├─ YES → Category 3 (Definition) or 4 (Procedural)
│  └─ NO → Continue
├─ Instruction + explanation restating it?
│  ├─ YES → Category 1 (Narrative)
│  └─ NO → Continue
├─ Multiple examples of same concept?
│  ├─ YES → Category 2 (Example)
│  └─ NO → Continue
├─ Explains WHY (rationale/benefits)?
│  ├─ YES → Category 5 (Rationale) - ALWAYS REMOVE
│  └─ NO → Continue
└─ Repetition for emphasis/learning?
   ├─ YES → Category 6 (Pedagogical) - CONTEXT-DEPENDENT
   └─ NO → Not redundancy, likely serves distinct purpose
```

### Application Workflow

Per section: Identify redundancy type → Apply fix (remove/consolidate/reference) → Verify clarity (4 Tests) → Document elimination

## Optimization Strategy

**Single-Pass**: Strengthen instructions + remove redundancy in one pass. Commit: "Optimize [filename] for conciseness and clarity"

**Multi-Pass** (complex docs): First pass strengthens + removes redundancy. Second/subsequent passes optimize further or no changes if optimal.

**User Workflow**: Run `/optimize-doc docs/file.md` → Review → Optional re-run → No changes when optimal

## Execution Instructions

1. **Read** the document specified: `{{arg}}`
2. **Create Backup** (MANDATORY before making changes):
   ```bash
   # Create unique ID for this optimization
   VALIDATION_ID="$(date +%s)-$$"

   # Create backup with timestamp
   BACKUP_FILE="{{arg}}.backup-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   cp "{{arg}}" "$BACKUP_FILE"
   echo "Created backup: $BACKUP_FILE"
   echo "Validation ID: $VALIDATION_ID"
   ```
3. **Analyze** each section using the methodology above
4. **Optimize** directly:
   - Strengthen vague instructions with explicit criteria
   - Remove redundant content while preserving clarity
   - Apply conciseness strategies where beneficial
5. **Validate** each condensed section:
   - **Re-read the condensed instruction independently** (without context of original)
   - **Apply the 4 Clarity Tests** from Step 2
   - **If any test fails**: Restore enough content to pass all 4 tests
   - **Document validation**: Note which sections were validated and passed

5B. **Category-Specific Validation** (Enhanced):

After condensing content, apply validation specific to redundancy type being removed:

**For Narrative Redundancy Removal**:
- [ ] Is instruction still complete without explanation?
- [ ] All parameters specified
- [ ] Success criteria clear
- [ ] No ambiguous terms undefined
- **Test**: Can Claude execute instruction without explanation?

**For Example Redundancy Removal**:
- [ ] Does remaining example(s) demonstrate full concept range?
- [ ] Shows boundary between correct/incorrect (if applicable)
- [ ] Covers edge cases (if applicable)
- [ ] Pattern extraction still possible
- **Test**: Can Claude recognize this pattern in new contexts?

**For Definition Redundancy Consolidation**:
- [ ] Is reference clear and non-disruptive?
- [ ] Reference at section boundary (not mid-workflow)
- [ ] Referenced definition is complete
- [ ] No circular references
- **Test**: Can Claude find definition without frustration?

**For Procedural Redundancy Consolidation**:
- [ ] Does consolidated procedure cover all use cases?
- [ ] Primary procedure has all steps from duplicates
- [ ] Context differences documented
- [ ] References don't break workflow
- **Test**: Can Claude execute from consolidated version?

**For Rationale Redundancy Removal**:
- [ ] Does instruction still convey success criteria?
- [ ] WHAT to do: Clear
- [ ] HOW to do it: Clear
- [ ] WHAT "correct" looks like: Clear
- [ ] WHY to do it: Removed (not needed)
- **Test**: Can Claude execute without understanding rationale?

**For Pedagogical Redundancy Removal**:
- [ ] Document type appropriate for removal?
- [ ] Reference document: Safe to remove repetition
- [ ] Tutorial/guide: Keep repetition for learning
- [ ] Mixed: Keep in learning sections, remove in reference sections
- **Test**: Does document type justify repetition?

**Validation Failure Recovery**: Identify failed check → Restore content → Re-validate → Document: "Partial removal, preserved X due to Y"

6. **Self-Review Changes** (MANDATORY before reporting):
   - **Stage changes**: `git add {{arg}}`
   - **Review diff**: `git diff --cached {{arg}} | head -200`
   - **Apply Critical Questions to ALL changes** (review each deleted/modified section in diff output):

     **Question 1: Was any meaning lost?**
     - Review each deleted line/section in the diff
     - Check: Does removed content specify what to produce, how to execute, or when to do it?
     - Check: Are any content specifications, methodology steps, or sequencing indicators removed?
     - If YES → **RESTORE** that content

     **Question 2: Was any vagueness introduced?**
     - Review each condensed instruction
     - Apply 4 Clarity Tests (Completeness, Unambiguous, Self-sufficient, Context preserved)
     - Check: Can this be interpreted in only ONE way without the original?
     - If NO → **RESTORE** specificity or add clarifying details

     **Question 3: Was any ability to execute properly lost?**
     - Review each modified workflow, checklist, or command sequence
     - Check: Can Claude execute this correctly without removed content?
     - Check: Are all parameters, file paths, and success criteria present?
     - Check: Is temporal ordering preserved (before/after/once relationships)?
     - If NO → **RESTORE** execution-critical content

   - **If ANY question reveals issues**: Use Edit tool to restore necessary content
   - **Validation**: Re-run self-review after fixes until all 3 questions pass
   - **Unstage if major issues found**: `git reset {{arg}}` and return to step 4

   - **Rollback if needed** (if major issues found that can't be easily fixed):
     ```bash
     # Find backup file and extract VALIDATION_ID
     BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
     VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"

     # Restore from backup
     cp "$BACKUP_FILE" "{{arg}}"
     echo "Restored from backup: $BACKUP_FILE"
     # Return to step 4 to try again
     ```

7. **Independent Validation** (MANDATORY for all documents):

   **Protocol Summary** (two-phase separation):
   ```
   Phase 1                          Phase 2
   ┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
   │ Create candidate    │         │ Create baseline     │
   │ Invoke validator    │    →    │ Resume validator    │
   │ Store agent ID      │         │ Compare files       │
   │ NO baseline exists  │         │ Report violations   │
   └─────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘
        Agent analyzes                  Agent compares
        candidate blind                 with full context
   ```

   **Key Constraint**: Baseline file MUST NOT exist during Phase 1. Validator sees candidate only, establishing genuine confusions before comparison.

   **⚠️ CRITICAL: Two-Phase Separation is MANDATORY**

   **❌ WRONG - Single-Phase Validation** (what NOT to do):
   ```bash
   # Creating both files at once - VIOLATES PROTOCOL
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
   VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"
   cp "{{arg}}" "/tmp/candidate-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   git show HEAD:{{arg}} > "/tmp/baseline-${VALIDATION_ID}"  # ← WRONG: Baseline created too early

   # Invoking validator with both file paths - VIOLATES PROTOCOL
   Task tool: general-purpose
   Prompt: "Compare /tmp/candidate-${VALIDATION_ID} with /tmp/baseline-${VALIDATION_ID}..."
   # ← WRONG: Validator can see both files, no genuine Phase 1 analysis
   ```

   **✅ CORRECT - Two-Phase Validation** (what TO do):
   - Phase 1: Create candidate ONLY → Invoke validator → Store agent ID
   - Phase 2: Create baseline → Resume validator with baseline path
   - Validator cannot cheat because baseline doesn't exist during Phase 1

   **Phase 1: Analyze Candidate Only**

   ```bash
   # Extract VALIDATION_ID from backup filename
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
   VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"

   # Create candidate file
   CANDIDATE_FILE="/tmp/candidate-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   cp "{{arg}}" "$CANDIDATE_FILE"

   # Invoke validator with literal file path (validator sees expanded path like /tmp/candidate-1762328795-3595)
   Task tool: general-purpose
   Model: sonnet
   Description: Validate optimization Phase 1
   Prompt: "You are an independent validator analyzing a documentation file.

   **FILE TO ANALYZE**: $CANDIDATE_FILE

   Read the above file completely from start to finish.

   **Document Your Questions**

   As you read, document genuine confusions that impact your ability to execute:
   - What is unclear or ambiguous?
   - Where do you feel uncertain about how to proceed?
   - What specific information seems unclear for execution?

   **Only document execution-impacting confusions** - not theoretical edge cases, rationale questions, or implementation details you don't need.

   **OUTPUT FORMAT**:

   ## Phase 1: Candidate Analysis

   ### Execution-Impacting Confusions

   If you have confusions, list them numbered (1, 2, 3...).
   If you have NO confusions, write only: "None"

   Do not write both."
   ```

   Store the agent ID for resume:
   ```bash
   # Extract agent ID using get-agent-id skill pattern
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
   VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"

   bash -c 'SESSION_ID="<session-id-from-context>" && VALIDATION_ID="'"$VALIDATION_ID"'" && AGENT_ID=$(jq -r "select(.toolUseResult.agentId) | .toolUseResult.agentId" /home/node/.config/projects/-workspace/${SESSION_ID}.jsonl 2>/dev/null | tail -1) && echo "$AGENT_ID" > "/tmp/validator-id-'"$VALIDATION_ID"'" && echo "Stored agent ID: $AGENT_ID"'
   ```

   See **get-agent-id** skill documentation for details and troubleshooting.

   **Checkpoint: Phase 1 Complete** (execute this bash script before Phase 2):
   ```bash
   # Extract VALIDATION_ID from backup filename
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
   VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"

   # Verify Phase 1 completed correctly
   BASELINE_FILE="/tmp/baseline-${VALIDATION_ID}"

   if [ -f "$BASELINE_FILE" ]; then
     echo "❌ ERROR: Baseline file exists during Phase 1 - protocol violation"
     exit 1
   fi

   VALIDATOR_AGENT_ID=$(cat "/tmp/validator-id-${VALIDATION_ID}" 2>/dev/null)
   if [ -z "$VALIDATOR_AGENT_ID" ]; then
     echo "❌ ERROR: Agent ID not stored - cannot resume for Phase 2"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "✅ Phase 1 complete - proceeding to Phase 2"
   ```

   **ONLY AFTER** checkpoint script succeeds proceed to Phase 2.

   **Phase 2: Compare with Baseline** (REQUIRES Phase 1 completion)

   **Prerequisites** (verify ALL before proceeding):
   - ✅ Phase 1 validator completed and returned results
   - ✅ Checkpoint script succeeded (see previous step)

   **If checkpoint failed**: Return to Phase 1, do NOT proceed.

   ```bash
   # Extract VALIDATION_ID from backup filename
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
   VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"

   # NOW create baseline file (validator already completed Phase 1)
   BASELINE_FILE="/tmp/baseline-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   CANDIDATE_FILE="/tmp/candidate-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   git show HEAD:{{arg}} > "$BASELINE_FILE"

   # Load validator agent ID
   VALIDATOR_AGENT_ID=$(cat "/tmp/validator-id-${VALIDATION_ID}")

   # Resume validator for Phase 2 with literal file paths (validator sees expanded paths)
   # CRITICAL: Use neutral language - do NOT reveal file relationship or optimization context
   # WRONG: "baseline (original)" or "candidate (optimized)" - creates confirmation bias
   # RIGHT: "File A" and "File B" - maintains neutrality
   Task tool: general-purpose
   Model: sonnet
   Description: Validate optimization Phase 2
   Resume: $VALIDATOR_AGENT_ID
   Prompt: "You are comparing two documentation files.

   **Files**:
   - File A: $BASELINE_FILE
   - File B: $CANDIDATE_FILE

   **Task**: Identify all differences, then evaluate for violations.

   **Step 1 - Find Differences**: List every change with line numbers and quoted content.

   **Step 2 - Classify Redundancy Type**: For each difference, determine if removed content matches a redundancy category:
   - **Category 1 (Narrative)**: Instruction followed by prose restatement of same logic?
   - **Category 2 (Example)**: Multiple examples showing identical principle without added value?
   - **Category 3 (Definition)**: Same term defined in multiple sections?
   - **Category 4 (Procedural)**: Same procedure in multiple places?
   - **Category 5 (Rationale)**: WHY explanations (educational, not operational)?
   - **Category 6 (Pedagogical)**: Repetition for emphasis in reference doc (not tutorial)?

   **Step 3 - Apply Taxonomy Rules**:
   - Categories 1, 5, 6 in reference docs → ACCEPTABLE removal (intended optimization)
   - Categories 2, 3, 4 → ACCEPTABLE if consolidated version preserves all information
   - If NOT redundancy category → Evaluate for violations below

   **Step 4 - Evaluate Non-Redundancy Changes**: For differences that don't match redundancy categories, check:
   - Content loss (instructions, steps, conditions, parameters removed)?
   - Clarity loss (is File A meaningfully clearer for execution)?
   - Emphasis shift (MANDATORY → optional-sounding)?
   - Phase 1 confusion resolution (does File A clarify confusion that File B doesn't)?

   If difference is redundancy removal (Categories 1-6) → ACCEPTABLE.
   If File B loses content/clarity/emphasis not classified as redundancy → VIOLATION.

   **Output Format**:

   ## Phase 2: File Comparison

   ### Differences
   [List each: Location (lines), Change description, Quoted content for both files, Redundancy classification if applicable]

   ### Redundancy Analysis
   [For each difference classified as redundancy: Category number, Why it matches, Verdict (ACCEPTABLE)]

   ### Violations
   [For non-redundancy differences only: Type, Impact, Verdict (VIOLATION/ACCEPTABLE), Severity if violation]

   ### Assessment
   - Overall: PASS/FAIL
   - Content: ✅/❌ | Clarity: ✅/❌ | Emphasis: ✅/❌ | Execution: ✅/❌
   - Differences: [count] | Redundancy Removals: [count] | Violations: [count] | Phase 1 Confusions Resolved by File A Only: [count if >0 → VIOLATIONS]"
   ```

   **After validation**:
   - If FAIL → Fix violations, re-run both phases until PASS
   - If PASS with execution-impacting confusions → Proceed to step 7B (Iterative Refinement)
   - If PASS with zero confusions → Proceed to step 8 (cleanup)

7B. **Iterative Clarity Refinement** (address execution-impacting confusions):

   **Trigger**: Validator reports PASS but documents execution-impacting confusions

   **Decision Criteria - Clarify ONLY if confusion impacts execution**:

   ✅ **Clarify these confusions**:
   - Unclear what command to run
   - Unclear what parameter to use
   - Unclear what condition to check
   - Unclear what "success" looks like
   - Ambiguous term with multiple interpretations affecting action
   - Missing step or requirement needed for correct execution

   ❌ **Do NOT clarify these**:
   - Wondering why a design choice was made (rationale)
   - Theoretical edge cases not needed for execution
   - Implementation details not relevant to task
   - Historical context or background information
   - Curiosity about alternatives not affecting execution

   **Refinement Process**:

   1. **Extract Execution-Impacting Confusions** (review validator report to identify which confusions are execution-impacting and document their line numbers)

   2. **Classify Each Confusion**:
      For each confusion, determine:
      - Does this prevent correct execution? (YES → clarify)
      - Is this just curiosity/rationale? (NO → skip)
      - Can validator still execute correctly despite confusion? (YES → skip)

   3. **Add Minimal Clarifications** (using Edit tool to modify {{arg}}):

      **Principles**:
      - Add ONLY enough text to resolve the specific confusion
      - Prefer inline examples over explanatory paragraphs
      - Prefer parenthetical clarifications over new sections
      - Do NOT re-introduce removed redundancy
      - Do NOT add rationale or educational content

      **Good Clarification Patterns**:
      ```markdown
      ✅ GOOD - Inline example:
      Delete the task from todo.md (remove entire line, not mark [x])

      ✅ GOOD - Parenthetical clarification:
      Run the build (mvn clean install)

      ✅ GOOD - Concrete example:
      Check if tests pass:
      ```bash
      mvn test
      # Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = failure
      ```

      ❌ BAD - Too much explanation:
      Delete the task from todo.md. By "delete" we mean completely remove
      the line from the file, as opposed to marking it complete with [x].
      This is because completed tasks should move to changelog.md instead
      of staying in todo.md. The deletion process involves opening todo.md,
      finding the task line, removing it, and saving the file.
      ```

   4. **Update Candidate File** (copy modified {{arg}} to candidate for re-validation)

   5. **Re-validate** (start fresh validation - Phase 1 then Phase 2):
      ```bash
      # Update candidate copy - reload paths from temp files
      VALIDATION_ID=$(cat /tmp/optimize-doc-validation-id.txt)
      CANDIDATE_FILE="/tmp/candidate-${VALIDATION_ID}"
      cp "{{arg}}" "$CANDIDATE_FILE"

      # Now invoke fresh validator agent for Phase 1 (see step 7)
      # Then proceed to Phase 2 with same baseline
      # Check if previous confusions are resolved
      ```

   6. **Iteration Control**:
      - Track iteration count (initialize at 0, increment after each refinement)
      - Maximum 3 iterations
      - After each iteration:
        - If validator reports no execution-impacting confusions → Proceed to step 8
        - If confusions resolved → Proceed to step 8
        - If confusions persist but iteration < 3 → Return to step 2
        - If iteration = 3 and execution-impacting confusions persist → **ROLLBACK** - Optimization failed, restore from backup

   **Decision Tree**:
   ```
   Validator reports confusions?
   ├─ NO → Proceed to step 8
   └─ YES → Are any execution-impacting?
      ├─ NO → Proceed to step 8 (theoretical/rationale only)
      └─ YES → Iteration count?
         ├─ 0-2 → Add minimal clarifications → Re-validate → Increment iteration
         └─ 3 → ROLLBACK - Restore from backup, optimization failed
   ```

   **CRITICAL**: Execution-impacting confusions MUST be resolved. If 3 iterations of clarification cannot resolve them, the optimization introduced ambiguity that wasn't in the original, so the optimization must be abandoned.

   **Example Refinement Cycle**:

   **Iteration 1**:
   - Validator confusion: "What does 'delete' mean - remove line or mark complete?"
   - Classification: Execution-impacting (affects action taken)
   - Clarification added: "Delete from todo.md (remove entire line, not mark [x])"
   - Re-validate → Check if resolved

   **Iteration 2** (if confusion persists):
   - Validator still confused about deletion scope
   - Enhanced clarification: Added concrete example showing before/after
   - Re-validate → Check if resolved

   **Iteration 3** (if still confused):
   - Final attempt with most explicit clarification possible
   - Re-validate → If still confused, **ROLLBACK**

   **Rollback Procedure** (if 3 iterations fail):
   ```bash
   # Extract VALIDATION_ID from backup filename
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
   VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"

   # Restore original file
   cp "$BACKUP_FILE" "{{arg}}"

   # Report failure
   echo "❌ OPTIMIZATION FAILED: Could not resolve execution-impacting confusions after 3 iterations"
   echo "File restored to original state"

   # Cleanup
   rm "$BACKUP_FILE"
   rm "/tmp/candidate-${VALIDATION_ID}" "/tmp/baseline-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   rm "/tmp/validator-id-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   exit 1
   ```

   **After refinement complete**:
   - Commit clarifications with message: "Add clarifications from validation feedback"
   - Proceed to step 8

8. **Remove Backup** (after validation and refinement complete):
   ```bash
   # Extract VALIDATION_ID from backup filename
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls "{{arg}}".backup-* 2>/dev/null | tail -1)
   VALIDATION_ID="${BACKUP_FILE##*.backup-}"

   # Remove backup and validation temp files
   rm "$BACKUP_FILE"
   rm "/tmp/candidate-${VALIDATION_ID}" "/tmp/baseline-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   rm "/tmp/validator-id-${VALIDATION_ID}"
   echo "Backup removed: Changes confirmed safe by independent validator"
   ```

9. **Report** changes made AND validation results:
   ```
   ## Optimization Summary

   **Changes Made**:
   1. [Section Name] (Lines X-Y): [Brief description]
      - Before: [Key issue]
      - After: [How improved]

   **Metrics**:
   - Lines removed: N
   - Net reduction: N lines (X%)
   - Sections optimized: M

     - Resolution: ✅ Resolved / ⚠️ Acceptable ambiguity

   [If no refinements needed:]
   **Refinement Status**: No execution-impacting confusions reported

   ## Self-Review

   **Optimizer's Assessment**:
   - Meaning Preservation: ✅ No operational instructions lost
   - Vagueness Check: ✅ All condensed sections pass 4 Clarity Tests
   - Executability: ✅ All workflows remain executable

   **Backup Status**: ✅ Removed (changes confirmed safe by independent validator)
   ```

10. **Commit** the optimized document with descriptive message

## Quality Standards

**Every change must satisfy ALL criteria:**
- ✅ **Meaning preserved**: Instructions mean exactly the same thing
- ✅ **Executability preserved**: Claude can execute correctly without removed content
- ✅ **Success criteria intact**: What "correct" looks like is still clear
- ✅ **Ambiguity resolved**: Any ambiguous terms still have defining examples
- ✅ **Conciseness increased**: Redundancy eliminated or prose tightened

**Verification Happens at FOUR Stages**:

### Stage 1: Per-Section Validation (Step 5)

Apply during optimization as each section is modified:

1. ✅ **Completeness preserved**: All commands, file paths, parameters present
2. ✅ **Unambiguous**: Can only be interpreted one way
3. ✅ **Self-sufficient**: No guessing required to execute
4. ✅ **Context preserved**: When/why to apply is clear

**Spot-check method**:
- Pick 5 random condensed sections
- Read ONLY the condensed version (cover original)
- Ask: "Could I execute this correctly without the original?"
- If NO for any → Restore content until YES

### Stage 2: Optimizer Self-Review (Step 6 - MANDATORY)

After ALL changes complete, optimizer reviews the full git diff:

**The 3 Critical Questions**:
1. **Was any meaning lost?** (operational instructions, content specs, methodology, sequencing)
2. **Was any vagueness introduced?** (4 Clarity Tests: Completeness, Unambiguous, Self-sufficient, Context)
3. **Was any ability to execute properly lost?** (workflows, parameters, success criteria, temporal ordering)

**Apply the 8-question Execution Test** (see "DECISION RULE: The Execution Test" section above) **to each change. If ANY test fails for execution-critical content → RESTORE**

**Result**: Self-review report with ✅ confirmations or list of issues found and fixed

### Stage 3: Independent Validation (Step 7 - MANDATORY for all docs)

**Independent validator agent** (fresh context, no bias) compares candidate against baseline:

**Two-Phase Approach with Difference-First Focus**:
1. **Phase 1 - Blind Candidate Analysis**: Document execution-impacting confusions without baseline access
2. **Phase 2 - Difference-Focused Comparison**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify ALL differences between baseline and candidate (what changed?)
   - **Step 2**: Evaluate each difference for violations (is the change acceptable?)

**Why Two Phases**:
- Baseline path hidden until Phase 2 (agent cannot access baseline during Phase 1)
- Full candidate read first establishes genuine confusions
- Difference-first priming prevents "they look the same" false negatives
- Two-step evaluation ensures thorough comparison

**Validator receives in Phase 1**: `/tmp/candidate-${ID}` path only, validation criteria
**Validator receives in Phase 2**: Both `/tmp/baseline-${ID}` and `/tmp/candidate-${ID}` paths with neutral labels (File A, File B)
**Validator does NOT receive**: File relationship context (which is "original"), optimization rationale, or biased labels like "(original)" or "(optimized)"
**Cannot cheat**: Baseline file path not provided until Phase 2 instructions
**Neutrality requirement**: Use "File A" and "File B" in prompts, not "baseline (original)" or "candidate (optimized)"

**Validation Process**:
1. Phase 1: Read candidate fully → Document confusions
2. Phase 2 Step 1: Read both files → List ALL differences with line numbers and quoted text
3. Phase 2 Step 2: For each difference → Evaluate for violations → Report verdict

**Result**: Independent validation report - PASS (proceed) or FAIL (fix violations and re-validate)

### Stage 4: Iterative Clarity Refinement (Step 7B - CONDITIONAL)

**Trigger**: Validator reports PASS but documents execution-impacting confusions

**Process**:
1. Extract confusions from validator report
2. Classify: Execution-impacting vs theoretical/rationale
3. For execution-impacting confusions: Add minimal clarifications
4. Re-validate to confirm resolution
5. Iterate up to 3 times maximum

**Principles**:
- Only clarify execution-impacting confusions
- Add minimal text (inline examples, parentheticals)
- Do NOT re-introduce removed redundancy
- Do NOT add rationale or educational content

**Result**: Either confusions resolved, or optimization rolled back

**Change Summary Format**:
```
## Optimization Summary
**Changes Made**: [Section] (Lines X-Y): [description] - Before: [issue] - After: [improvement]
**Metrics**: Lines removed: N | Sections strengthened: M | Redundancy: [examples]
**Next Steps**: [Run again if needed | Complete if optimal]
```

## Success Criteria

- Document is more concise (fewer lines, tighter prose)
- Instructions are clearer (explicit criteria, measurable steps)
- All necessary information preserved (no loss of meaning)
- User can execute instructions without ambiguity
