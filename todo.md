## Detailed Task Specifications

### `benchmark-concurrency-architectures` Task Details

**Objective:** Compare file-based concurrency vs block-based concurrency to determine optimal parallelization strategy.

**Background:**
Current evidence shows file-level parallelism (like Checkstyle/PMD) eliminates 16-99x synchronization overhead. However, post-parse AST becomes read-only and immutable, potentially enabling method-level parallelism within files after parsing completes.

**Architectures to Compare:**

1. **File-Based Concurrency (Baseline)**
   - One thread per file (current industry standard)
   - Single-threaded parsing and formatting per file
   - Multiple files processed concurrently
   - AST instance reused per worker thread via reset()

2. **Hybrid Block-Based Concurrency (Innovation)**
   - Phase 1: Single-threaded parsing per file (creates read-only AST)
   - Phase 2: Multi-threaded method-level formatting from read-only AST
   - File-level parallelism + method-level parallelism
   - Requires thread-safe read operations from Index-Overlay AST

**Benchmarking Requirements:**

1. **File Size Variations:**
   - Small files: 1-5 methods, <200 LOC
   - Medium files: 10-50 methods, 200-1000 LOC
   - Large files: 100+ methods, 1000+ LOC
   - Very large files: 500+ methods, 5000+ LOC

2. **Thread Pool Configurations:**
   - File workers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 threads
   - Method workers (hybrid): 2, 4, 8, 16 threads per file
   - Measure optimal ratios for different file sizes

3. **Metrics to Measure:**
   - Total processing time (end-to-end)
   - CPU utilization and core efficiency
   - Memory usage and GC pressure
   - Thread coordination overhead
   - Context switching costs

4. **Test Scenarios:**
   - Homogeneous workloads (all small, all medium, all large files)
   - Mixed workloads (realistic distribution of file sizes)
   - Memory-constrained environments
   - CPU-bound vs I/O-bound scenarios

5. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Implementation complexity comparison
   - Maintenance overhead assessment
   - Bug surface area evaluation
   - Thread-safety validation requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- Hybrid approach shows >15% improvement for files with 20+ methods
- Overhead complexity justified by performance gains
- Thread-safety validated through concurrent stress testing
- Memory usage remains acceptable (no more than 2x increase)

**Evidence Base:**
- Current benchmarks show Index-Overlay read operations: 87.9 ns/op (thread-safe when read-only)
- AST visitor pattern supports independent method processing
- Post-parse AST immutability enables safe concurrent reads
- JavaParser research confirms "method independence" for formatting rules

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use JMH for precise microbenchmarks
- Test with real Java codebases (Spring, Apache Commons, etc.)
- Validate thread-safety through race condition detection
- Measure at different JVM heap sizes and GC algorithms
