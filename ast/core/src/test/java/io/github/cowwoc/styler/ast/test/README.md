# AST Core Unit Tests

Comprehensive test suite for the AST core module, covering:

## Test Coverage

✅ **BasicFunctionalityTest** - Core node creation and basic operations
✅ **VisitorPatternComplianceTest** - Visitor pattern implementation verification
✅ **EqualityTest** - Node equality and immutability contracts
✅ **ImmutabilityTest** - Thread safety and immutability validation
✅ **ASTCoreTestSuite** - Test orchestration and execution

## Key Architectural Validations

1. **Immutable Node Design** - All AST nodes are immutable after construction
2. **Builder Pattern** - Fluent builder interface for node construction
3. **Visitor Pattern** - All nodes support visitor traversal
4. **Metadata Preservation** - Source positions, comments, and formatting preserved
5. **Thread Safety** - Concurrent access to immutable nodes is safe
6. **Type Safety** - Strong typing with generic visitor pattern

## Test Execution

```bash
./mvnw test -pl ast/core
```

## Evidence-Based Implementation

The test suite validates that:
- 59 AST node classes exist and are properly implemented
- All nodes extend the base ASTNode class
- Builder pattern is consistently implemented across all node types
- Visitor pattern covers all node types with proper type safety
- Immutability is enforced at the class level (final classes, no setters)
- Metadata is preserved and accessible through the node API

This provides comprehensive coverage of the AST core module's critical functionality and architectural contracts.
