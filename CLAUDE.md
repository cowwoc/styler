# Claude Code Configuration Guide

Styler Java Code Formatter project configuration and workflow guidance.

## üö® MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: [docs/project/task-protocol.md](docs/project/task-protocol.md) - MANDATORY risk-based protocol selection - Apply appropriate workflow based on file risk classification.
**CRITICAL LOCK OWNERSHIP**: See [¬ß Lock Ownership & Task Recovery](#-lock-ownership--task-recovery) for complete lock file requirements and ownership rules.
**CRITICAL WORKTREE ISOLATION**: See [¬ß Worktree Isolation & Cleanup](#-worktree-isolation--cleanup) for complete worktree management requirements.
**CRITICAL STYLE**: Complete style validation = checkstyle + PMD + manual rules - See task-protocol.md
**CRITICAL PERSISTENCE**: [Long-term solution persistence](#-long-term-solution-persistence) - MANDATORY prioritization of optimal solutions over expedient alternatives.
**CRITICAL TASK COMPLETION**: Tasks are NOT complete until ALL 7 phases of task protocol are finished. Implementation completion does NOT equal task completion. Only mark tasks as complete after Phase 7 cleanup and finalization.
**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION TRIGGER**: When you have finished implementation work (code changes, fixes, features complete), you MUST complete ALL remaining protocol phases before selecting a new task. The SessionStart hook indicates if you own an active task requiring completion.

**Prohibited Pattern**: ‚ùå "Implementation is done, let me look for what to work on next" (while protocol incomplete)
**Required Pattern**: ‚úÖ "Implementation is done. Continuing with Phase 6 reviews and Phase 7 cleanup."

**PHASE COMPLETION VERIFICATION**: Before declaring ANY phase complete, you MUST:
1. **READ**: Execute `grep -A 20 "^## State [N]:" docs/project/task-protocol.md` to read ACTUAL phase requirements
2. **CHECKLIST**: Create explicit checklist of all phase requirements from task-protocol.md
3. **VERIFY**: Confirm EACH requirement is met with evidence (command output, file checks, etc.)
4. **DECLARE**: Only after ALL requirements verified, declare phase complete

**Prohibited Pattern**: ‚ùå "Phase N is complete" (based on assumption)
**Required Pattern**: ‚úÖ "Reading Phase N requirements... [shows grep output]... Requirements: [list from doc]... Executing: [commands with output]... Verified: [checklist with evidence]... Phase N complete"

**Example:**
‚ùå BAD: "Phase 7 complete! I committed changes and marked task as done in todo.md"
‚úÖ GOOD: "Reading Phase 7 requirements... Requirements: commit ALL changes (code + todo.md removal + changelog.md addition) in single atomic commit, merge to main, remove worktree, release lock... Executing: [shows single commit with all changes]... Verified: [checklist with evidence]... Phase 7 complete"

**Detailed Archival Example:**

‚ùå **WRONG** (marking task complete in todo.md):
```bash
# Modified todo.md: changed - [ ] to - [x], added completion details
vim todo.md  # Line 547: - [x] **TASK:** debug-maven-build-cache...

git add todo.md pom.xml docs/project/build-system.md
git commit -m "Fix Maven build cache..."
# Result: Task still in todo.md ‚ùå, not in changelog.md ‚ùå
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT** (moving task from todo.md to changelog.md):
```bash
# Step 1: DELETE task from todo.md (remove entire entry, lines 547-567)
vim todo.md  # Delete all lines for debug-maven-build-cache-stale-instances

# Step 2: ADD task to changelog.md under ## 2025-10-08
vim changelog.md  # Add completion entry with full details

# Step 3: Verify archival
grep "debug-maven-build-cache" todo.md && echo "‚ùå ERROR: Still in todo.md!"
grep "debug-maven-build-cache" changelog.md || echo "‚ùå ERROR: Not in changelog.md!"

# Step 4: Commit both files together
git add todo.md changelog.md pom.xml docs/project/build-system.md
git commit -m "Fix Maven build cache..."  # Single atomic commit
# Result: Task removed from todo.md ‚úÖ, added to changelog.md ‚úÖ
```

**TODO Synchronization**: Keep TodoWrite tool synced with todo.md file.
**TODO Clarity**: Each todo.md entry must contain sufficient detail to understand the task without external context. One-line descriptions require nested sub-items explaining Purpose, Scope, Components/Features, and Integration points.
**CRITICAL TASK ARCHIVAL**: When completing a task (Phase 7/COMPLETE state), you MUST:
1. **REMOVE** the completed task from todo.md (delete the entire task entry)
2. **ADD** it to changelog.md under the appropriate date section (format: `## YYYY-MM-DD`)
3. **INCLUDE** completion details: solution implemented, files modified, test results, quality gates, completion date
4. **COMMIT** all changes in ONE atomic commit (implementation code + todo.md removal + changelog.md addition)
5. **FORMAT** changelog entries to match existing style (see changelog.md for examples)

**üö® PROHIBITED ARCHIVAL PATTERNS**:
‚ùå Changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in todo.md (tasks must be REMOVED, not marked complete)
‚ùå Adding completion details to todo.md entry (details go to changelog.md, not todo.md)
‚ùå Committing todo.md changes without corresponding changelog.md addition
‚ùå Leaving completed tasks in todo.md for "historical reference"

**‚úÖ REQUIRED ARCHIVAL PATTERNS**:
‚úÖ `git diff todo.md` shows ONLY deletions (lines removed, no modifications)
‚úÖ `git diff changelog.md` shows ONLY additions under today's date
‚úÖ Both files modified in SAME commit
‚úÖ Task completely absent from todo.md after commit

**ARCHIVAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST** (run before Phase 7 commit):
```bash
# Automated verification script (recommended)
bash .claude/hooks/verify-task-archival.sh task-name

# OR manual verification:
# 1. Verify task REMOVED from todo.md (not just marked complete)
grep -q "task-name" todo.md && {
    echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Task still in todo.md - must be REMOVED"
    exit 1
}

# 2. Verify task ADDED to changelog.md
grep -q "task-name" changelog.md || {
    echo "‚ùå VIOLATION: Task not in changelog.md - must be ADDED"
    exit 1
}

# 3. Verify both files staged
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "todo.md" || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è todo.md not staged"
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "changelog.md" || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è changelog.md not staged"
```

**CRITICAL MID-TASK WORK CAPTURE**: When user mentions additional work during task execution, IMMEDIATELY add it to TodoWrite list to prevent loss due to context compaction. NEVER rely on memory across compaction boundaries - capture ALL new work requests in TodoWrite tool as they occur.
**CRITICAL TOKEN USAGE**: Token usage MUST NEVER affect behavior, implementation approach, or task completion. IGNORE all token usage warnings and limits. Continue working with full quality and completeness until task is 100% complete or explicit user instruction. Token budget does NOT justify incomplete implementations, shortcuts, or quality compromises.
**CRITICAL BUG TESTING**: [Unit Test Driven Bug Fixing](#-unit-test-driven-bug-fixing) - MANDATORY test-first approach for ALL bugs to prevent regressions.
**üö® VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE TASK RESTART REQUIRED**

## üö® LOCK OWNERSHIP & TASK RECOVERY {#lock-ownership}

**CRITICAL**: After context compaction, the `check-lock-ownership.sh` SessionStart hook automatically checks for active tasks owned by this session and provides specific instructions.

**Lock Ownership Rule**: ONLY work on tasks whose lock file contains YOUR session_id.

**üö® LOCK FILE VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:

1. **NEVER manually search for lock files** - The SessionStart hook performs this check automatically
2. **TRUST the hook output** - If it says "No Active Tasks", you have NO tasks regardless of other files
3. **ONLY `.json` files are valid** - Lock files MUST be `/workspace/locks/{task-name}.json`
4. **Invalid extensions are NEVER valid**:
   - ‚ùå `/workspace/locks/task-name.lock` - INVALID, will be ignored
   - ‚ùå `/workspace/locks/task-name.txt` - INVALID, will be ignored
   - ‚ùå Any extension other than `.json` - INVALID, will be ignored
5. **If you see your session_id in a non-.json file**: Delete it immediately, it's incorrect
6. **NEVER remove lock files unless you own them** - session_id must match
7. **If lock acquisition fails** - Select alternative task, do NOT delete the lock

**Lock File Format**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "unique-session-identifier",
  "task_name": "task-name-matching-filename",
  "state": "current-protocol-phase",
  "created_at": "ISO-8601-timestamp"
}
```

## üö® WORKTREE ISOLATION & CLEANUP {#worktree-isolation}

### During Task Execution

**CRITICAL WORKTREE ISOLATION**: After creating worktree, IMMEDIATELY `cd` to worktree directory BEFORE any other operations.

**Required Pattern**:
```bash
git worktree add /workspace/branches/{task}/code -b {task} && cd /workspace/branches/{task}/code
```

**ALL subsequent work must occur inside worktree, NEVER in main branch.**

**Verification Before Proceeding**:
```bash
pwd | grep -q "/workspace/branches/{task}/code$" && echo "‚úÖ In worktree" || echo "‚ùå ERROR: Not in worktree!"
```

### During Cleanup (Phase 7/8)

**CRITICAL WORKTREE CLEANUP**: BEFORE removing worktree, MUST `cd` to main worktree first.

**Required Pattern**:
```bash
cd /workspace/branches/main/code && git worktree remove /workspace/branches/{task}/code
```

**NEVER remove a worktree while inside it** - shell loses working directory. This is MANDATORY in Phase 8 (CLEANUP).

**Prohibited Pattern**: ‚ùå Being inside `/workspace/branches/{task}/code` and running `git worktree remove /workspace/branches/{task}/code`
**Required Pattern**: ‚úÖ Change to main worktree first, then remove task worktree

## üö® TASK PROTOCOL SUMMARY {#task-protocol}

**Full Protocol Details**: See [task-protocol.md](docs/project/task-protocol.md) for complete state machine and transition requirements.

**State Machine**: INIT ‚Üí CLASSIFIED ‚Üí REQUIREMENTS ‚Üí SYNTHESIS ‚Üí IMPLEMENTATION ‚Üí VALIDATION ‚Üí REVIEW ‚Üí COMPLETE ‚Üí CLEANUP

**Critical Requirements for All Tasks**:
- Lock acquisition (see [¬ß Lock Ownership](#lock-ownership))
- Worktree isolation (see [¬ß Worktree Isolation](#worktree-isolation))
- Build verification before merge
- Unanimous stakeholder approval (Phase 6/REVIEW)
- Complete all phases before selecting new task

**Risk-Based Variants**:
- **HIGH-RISK** (src/\*\*, pom.xml, security/\*\*): Full 7-phase protocol with all agents
- **MEDIUM-RISK** (tests, docs): Abbreviated protocol, domain-specific agents
- **LOW-RISK** (general docs): Streamlined protocol, minimal validation

**Post-Compaction Note**: This summary plus lock ownership and worktree isolation rules above are sufficient for basic protocol compliance when task-protocol.md is not accessible.

## üö® RISK-BASED PROTOCOL SELECTION

**PROTOCOL SELECTION BASED ON FILE RISK:**
- **HIGH-RISK**: Full 7-phase protocol (src/\*\*, pom.xml, .github/\*\*, security/\*\*, CLAUDE.md)
- **MEDIUM-RISK**: Abbreviated protocol (test files, code-style docs, configuration)
- **LOW-RISK**: Streamlined protocol (general docs, todo.md, README files)

**AUTOMATIC RISK ASSESSMENT:**
‚úÖ Pattern-based file classification determines workflow variant
‚úÖ Escalation triggers force higher risk levels when needed
‚úÖ Manual overrides available for edge cases
‚úÖ Default to full protocol when risk unclear

**EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS:**
‚úÖ Documentation updates: 99%+ faster (5min ‚Üí 0.2s)
‚úÖ Safety preserved: Critical files always get full review
‚úÖ Backward compatible: Existing workflows unchanged

**BATCH PROCESSING - AUTOMATIC CONTINUOUS MODE:**
‚úÖ "Work on multiple tasks until done" - Auto-translates to continuous workflow mode
‚úÖ "Complete all Phase 1 tasks" - Auto-translates to continuous mode with phase filtering
‚úÖ "Work on study-claude-cli-interface task" - Single task with proper isolation
‚ùå Manual batch processing within single protocol execution - PROHIBITED

## üö® STAKEHOLDER CONSENSUS ENFORCEMENT

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL VIOLATION PREVENTION**: Phase 6 requires UNANIMOUS stakeholder approval

**MANDATORY DECISION LOGIC**:
- ALL agents must respond with "FINAL DECISION: ‚úÖ APPROVED"
- ANY agent with "‚ùå REJECTED" ‚Üí MANDATORY Phase 5 execution + Phase 6 re-run
- NO human override permitted - agent decisions are ATOMIC and BINDING
- NO subjective "MVP scope" or "enhancement-level" assessments allowed

**PROHIBITED PATTERNS**:
‚ùå "Considering the MVP nature, I'll proceed despite rejections"
‚ùå "Privacy issues are enhancement-level, not blocking"
‚ùå "Since critical security is fixed, I'll finalize the task"

**REQUIRED PATTERN**:
‚úÖ "Agent X returned ‚ùå REJECTED, executing Phase 5 resolution cycle"
‚úÖ "Re-running Phase 6 after addressing all stakeholder concerns"
‚úÖ "Continuing until ALL agents return ‚úÖ APPROVED"

## üö® AUTONOMOUS TASK COMPLETION REQUIREMENT

**CRITICAL**: Once you begin a task (execute INIT state), you MUST complete ALL protocol states (0-8) autonomously, WITH TWO MANDATORY USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINTS.

**MANDATORY SINGLE-SESSION COMPLETION**:
- Task execution occurs in ONE uninterrupted session
- **EXPECTED USER APPROVAL CHECKPOINTS** (these are NOT violations):
  1. **After SYNTHESIS**: Present implementation plan via ExitPlanMode, wait for user approval
  2. **After REVIEW**: Present completed changes, wait for user approval to finalize
- NO OTHER HANDOFFS to user mid-protocol
- Complete all other states autonomously

**Prohibited Mid-Task Questions** (other than the two mandatory checkpoints):
‚ùå "Would you like me to continue with implementation?" (after user approved plan)
‚ùå "This will take 2-3 days, should I proceed?" (ask before INIT, not during)
‚ùå "Select a different task or continue this one?" (not during execution)
‚ùå "Requires extended work session - continue?" (not during execution)

**When to Ask User**:
‚úÖ **BEFORE** starting task: "Task X has ambiguous requirements. Clarify before I begin?"
‚úÖ **AFTER SYNTHESIS**: Present plan via ExitPlanMode, wait for approval before IMPLEMENTATION
‚úÖ **AFTER REVIEW**: Present changes, wait for approval before COMPLETE
‚úÖ **NEVER** at other points: Complete other states autonomously once INIT begins

**Time Estimates Are NOT Blockers**:
- "2-3 days" = **effort estimation**, NOT permission gate
- You MUST complete implementation regardless of estimated duration
- Token budget NEVER justifies incomplete work (per CRITICAL TOKEN USAGE above)
- Complexity NEVER justifies asking permission mid-task
- "Multi-day effort" is NORMAL for implementation tasks

**Only Stop Mid-Protocol If**:
1. **Genuine External Blocker**: API unavailable, missing credentials, network failure
2. **Ambiguous Conflicting Requirements**: No resolution path exists between stakeholder requirements
3. **User Explicit Interruption**: User says "stop" or modifies todo.md mid-execution

**NOT Legitimate Stopping Reasons**:
‚ùå Task is complex
‚ùå Task takes time
‚ùå Token usage high
‚ùå "This might be too much work"
‚ùå "Should I ask the user first?"

**Enforcement**: The `detect-giving-up.sh` hook detects mid-protocol abandonment patterns and injects completion reminders.

## üö® TASK UNAVAILABILITY HANDLING

**CRITICAL**: When user requests "work on the next task" or similar, you MUST verify task availability before attempting to start any work.

### Mandatory Availability Check

**BEFORE attempting to select or start ANY task:**
1. Check todo.md for available tasks with `READY` status
2. Verify task dependencies are met (check for `BLOCKED` status)
3. Check `/workspace/locks/` for existing locks on available tasks
4. Confirm at least ONE task is available AND accessible

### Required Response When No Tasks Available

**If ALL tasks are unavailable, you MUST:**
1. **STOP immediately** - Do NOT attempt to start any work
2. **EXPLAIN clearly** why no tasks are available
3. **PROVIDE specifics** about what's blocking progress

**Required Explanation Format:**
```
I cannot proceed with any tasks because:

**Task Availability Analysis:**
- Total tasks in todo.md: X
- Tasks with READY status: Y
- Tasks currently locked by other sessions: Z
- Tasks blocked by dependencies: W

**Specific Blockers:**
1. [Task Name]: BLOCKED - Dependencies: [list dependencies]
2. [Task Name]: LOCKED - Owned by session [session-id]
3. [Task Name]: BLOCKED - Dependencies: [list dependencies]

**Next Steps:**
- Wait for [specific task] to complete, OR
- Wait for locks held by other sessions to be released, OR
- No tasks remain in todo.md (all work complete)

I will stop here and await further instructions.
```

### Prohibited Patterns

**NEVER do any of the following when all tasks are unavailable:**
‚ùå Select a blocked task and attempt to start work
‚ùå Try to work around missing dependencies
‚ùå Attempt to create new tasks not in todo.md
‚ùå Ask user vague questions like "What should I work on?"
‚ùå Proceed with any work when clear blockers exist
‚ùå Suggest working on tasks that violate dependency requirements

### Required Patterns

**ALWAYS do the following when all tasks are unavailable:**
‚úÖ Stop immediately after determining no tasks available
‚úÖ Provide detailed analysis of why each task is unavailable
‚úÖ Explain specific conditions needed for tasks to become available
‚úÖ Wait for user to resolve blockers or provide new instructions
‚úÖ Check both BLOCKED status AND lock files AND dependencies

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: All tasks blocked by dependencies**
```
I cannot proceed with any tasks because:

**Task Availability Analysis:**
- Total tasks in todo.md: 15
- Tasks with READY status: 0
- All remaining tasks: BLOCKED

**Specific Blockers:**
1. A1-A4: BLOCKED - Dependencies: A0 (setup-maven-multi-module-build) must complete first
2. B1-B5: BLOCKED - Dependencies: All Phase A tasks must complete first
3. C1-C6: BLOCKED - Dependencies: Phase B tasks must complete first

**Next Steps:**
- Task A0 (setup-maven-multi-module-build) must be completed before any other tasks can begin
- Once A0 completes, tasks A1-A4 will become available

I will stop here and await further instructions.
```

**Scenario 2: All tasks locked by other sessions**
```
I cannot proceed with any tasks because:

**Task Availability Analysis:**
- Total tasks in todo.md: 5
- Tasks with READY status: 5
- Tasks currently locked by other sessions: 5

**Specific Blockers:**
1. implement-parser: LOCKED - Owned by session abc-123-def
2. implement-config: LOCKED - Owned by session xyz-789-ghi
3. implement-cli: LOCKED - Owned by session jkl-456-mno
4. implement-security: LOCKED - Owned by session pqr-012-stu
5. implement-formatter: LOCKED - Owned by session vwx-345-yza

**Next Steps:**
- Wait for other sessions to complete their work and release locks
- Check back periodically to see if any tasks become available

I will stop here and await further instructions.
```

**Scenario 3: No tasks remaining**
```
I cannot proceed with any tasks because:

**Task Availability Analysis:**
- Total tasks in todo.md: 0
- All tasks have been completed and archived to changelog.md

**Conclusion:**
All planned work has been completed. The todo list is empty.

**Next Steps:**
- Review completed work in changelog.md
- User may add new tasks to todo.md if additional work is needed

I will stop here and await further instructions.
```

### Enforcement

The behavior is MANDATORY and will be monitored through:
- Hook validation of task selection patterns
- Verification that blocked/locked tasks are never started
- Confirmation that clear explanations are provided when stopping

## üéØ COMPLETE STYLE VALIDATION

**AUTOMATED GUIDANCE**: The `smart-doc-prompter.sh` hook automatically injects the 3-component checklist when style work is detected.

**MANDATORY PROCESS**: When user requests "apply style guide" or similar:

1. **NEVER assume checkstyle-only** - Style guide consists of THREE components
2. **FOLLOW PROTOCOL**: task-protocol.md "Complete Style Validation Gate" pattern
3. **MANUAL VERIFICATION**: Check docs/code-style/\*-claude.md detection patterns
4. **ALL THREE REQUIRED**: checkstyle + PMD + manual rules must ALL pass

**CRITICAL ERROR PATTERN**: Checking only checkstyle and declaring "no violations found" when PMD/manual violations exist

**AUTOMATED FIXING INTEGRATION**: When LineLength vs UnderutilizedLines conflicts are detected:
1. **Use Java-Based Fixer**: `checkstyle/fixers` module implements AST-based consolidate-then-split strategy
2. **Guidance Hook**: Automatically suggests fixer when Java files are modified
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test suite validates fixing logic before application
4. **Manual Verification**: Always verify automated fixes meet business logic requirements

## üéØ LONG-TERM SOLUTION PERSISTENCE

**MANDATORY PRINCIPLE**: Prioritize optimal long-term solutions over expedient alternatives. Persistence and thorough problem-solving are REQUIRED.

### üö® CRITICAL PERSISTENCE REQUIREMENTS

**SOLUTION QUALITY HIERARCHY**:
1. **OPTIMAL SOLUTION**: Complete, maintainable, follows best practices, addresses root cause
2. **ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION**: Functional, meets core requirements, minor technical debt acceptable
3. **EXPEDIENT WORKAROUND**: Quick fix, creates technical debt, only acceptable with explicit justification and follow-up task

**MANDATORY DECISION PROTOCOL**:
- **FIRST ATTEMPT**: Always pursue the OPTIMAL SOLUTION approach
- **IF BLOCKED**: Analyze the blocking issue and determine resolution strategy
- **BEFORE DOWNGRADING**: Must exhaust reasonable effort toward optimal solution
- **NEVER ABANDON**: Complex problems require persistence, not shortcuts

### üö® PROHIBITED DOWNGRADE PATTERNS

**ANTI-PATTERNS - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**:
‚ùå "This is too complex, let me try a simpler approach" (without justification)
‚ùå "The optimal solution would take too long" (without effort estimation)
‚ùå "Let's use a quick workaround for now" (without technical debt assessment)
‚ùå "I'll implement the minimum viable solution" (when requirements specify comprehensive solution)
‚ùå "Due to complexity and token usage, I'll create a solid MVP implementation" (complexity/tokens never justify incomplete implementation)
‚ùå "Given token constraints, I'll implement a basic version" (token budget does not override quality requirements)
‚ùå "This edge case is too hard to handle properly" (without stakeholder consultation)
‚ùå "The existing pattern is suboptimal but I'll follow it" (without improvement attempt)

### üö® GIVING UP DETECTION PATTERNS

**AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT**: Runtime detection via `/workspace/.claude/hooks/detect-giving-up.sh`

**MANDATORY RESPONSE TO GIVING UP PATTERNS**:
‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY return to the original technical problem
‚úÖ Apply systematic debugging and decomposition approach
‚úÖ Continue working on the exact issue that triggered the pattern
‚úÖ Use incremental progress rather than abandoning the work
‚úÖ Exhaust all reasonable technical approaches before any scope modification
‚úÖ Document specific technical blockers if genuine limitations exist

### üß™ UNIT TEST DRIVEN BUG FIXING

**MANDATORY PROCESS**: When encountering any bug during development:

**BUG DISCOVERY PROTOCOL**:
1. **IMMEDIATE UNIT TEST**: Create a minimal unit test that reproduces the exact bug
2. **ISOLATION**: Extract the failing behavior into the smallest possible test case
3. **DOCUMENTATION**: Add the test to appropriate test suite with descriptive name
4. **FIX VALIDATION**: Ensure the unit test passes after implementing the fix
5. **REGRESSION PREVENTION**: Keep the test in the permanent test suite

**UNIT TEST REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Specific**: Target the exact failing behavior, not general functionality
- **Minimal**: Use the smallest possible input that triggers the bug
- **Descriptive**: Test method name clearly describes the bug scenario
- **Isolated**: Independent of other tests and external dependencies
- **Fast**: Execute quickly to enable frequent testing

**EXAMPLES**:
‚úÖ `testScientificNotationLexing()` - for floating-point literal bugs
‚úÖ `testMethodReferenceInAssignment()` - for parser syntax bugs
‚úÖ `testEnumConstantWithArguments()` - for enum parsing bugs
‚úÖ `testGenericTypeVariableDeclaration()` - for generics bugs

**INTEGRATION**: Unit tests become part of the development workflow, not separate documentation

**REQUIRED JUSTIFICATION PROCESS** (when considering downgrade):
1. **DOCUMENT EFFORT**: "Attempted optimal solution for X hours/attempts"
2. **IDENTIFY BLOCKERS**: "Specific technical obstacles: [list]"
3. **STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION**: "Consulting domain authorities for guidance"
4. **TECHNICAL DEBT ASSESSMENT**: "Proposed workaround creates debt in areas: [list]"
5. **FOLLOW-UP COMMITMENT**: "Created todo.md task for proper solution: [task-name]"

### üõ°Ô∏è STAKEHOLDER AGENT PERSISTENCE ENFORCEMENT

**AGENT DECISION STANDARDS**:
- **TECHNICAL-ARCHITECT**: Must validate architectural completeness, not just basic functionality
- **CODE-QUALITY-AUDITOR**: Must enforce best practices, not accept "good enough" code
- **SECURITY-AUDITOR**: Must ensure comprehensive security, not just absence of obvious vulnerabilities
- **PERFORMANCE-ANALYZER**: Must validate efficiency, not just absence of performance regressions
- **STYLE-AUDITOR**: Must enforce complete style compliance, not just major violation fixes

**MANDATORY REJECTION CRITERIA** (agents must reject if present):
‚ùå Incomplete implementation with "TODO: finish later" comments
‚ùå Known edge cases left unhandled without explicit deferral justification
‚ùå Suboptimal algorithms when better solutions are feasible
‚ùå Technical debt introduction without compelling business justification
‚ùå Partial compliance with requirements when full compliance is achievable

### üîß IMPLEMENTATION PERSISTENCE PATTERNS

**WHEN ENCOUNTERING COMPLEX PROBLEMS**:
1. **DECOMPOSITION**: Break complex problems into manageable sub-problems
2. **RESEARCH**: Investigate existing patterns, libraries, and best practices
3. **INCREMENTAL PROGRESS**: Make steady progress rather than abandoning for easier alternatives
4. **ITERATIVE REFINEMENT**: Improve solution quality through multiple passes
5. **STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION**: Leverage agent expertise for guidance and validation

**PERSISTENCE CHECKPOINTS**:
- Before every major architectural decision: "Is this the best long-term approach?"
- Before accepting technical debt: "Have I exhausted reasonable alternatives?"
- Before deferring complex work: "Is this truly beyond current task scope?"
- Before implementing workarounds: "Will this create maintainability problems?"

**EFFORT ESCALATION PROTOCOL**:
1. **STANDARD EFFORT**: Normal problem-solving approach (default)
2. **ENHANCED EFFORT**: Additional research, alternative approaches, stakeholder consultation
3. **COLLABORATIVE EFFORT**: Multi-agent coordination for complex architectural challenges
4. **DOCUMENTED DEFERRAL**: Only after stakeholder consensus that effort exceeds reasonable scope

### üö® SCOPE NEGOTIATION PERSISTENCE INTEGRATION

**ENHANCED SCOPE ASSESSMENT** (extends task-protocol.md Phase 5):
When evaluating whether to defer work via scope negotiation:

**MANDATORY PERSISTENCE EVALUATION**:
1. **COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS**: "Is this genuinely complex or just requiring more effort?"
2. **LEARNING CURVE ASSESSMENT**: "Would investment in learning create long-term capability?"
3. **TECHNICAL DEBT COST**: "What maintenance burden does deferral create?"
4. **STAKEHOLDER VALUE**: "Does optimal solution provide significantly more value?"

**DEFERRAL JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS**:
- **SCOPE MISMATCH**: Work genuinely extends beyond original task boundaries
- **EXPERTISE GAP**: Requires domain knowledge not available to current session
- **DEPENDENCY BLOCKING**: Blocked by external factors beyond current control
- **RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS**: Genuinely exceeds reasonable time/effort allocation

**PROHIBITED DEFERRAL REASONS**:
‚ùå "This is harder than I expected"
‚ùå "The easy solution works fine"
‚ùå "Perfect is the enemy of good"
‚ùå "We can improve this later"
‚ùå "This level of quality isn't necessary"

### üéØ SUCCESS METRICS AND VALIDATION

**SOLUTION QUALITY INDICATORS**:
‚úÖ Addresses root cause, not just symptoms
‚úÖ Follows established architectural patterns and best practices
‚úÖ Includes comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
‚úÖ Maintains or improves system maintainability
‚úÖ Provides clear, long-term value beyond minimum requirements
‚úÖ Receives unanimous stakeholder approval without quality compromises

**PERSISTENCE VALIDATION CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] Attempted optimal solution approach first
- [ ] Investigated alternatives when blocked
- [ ] Consulted stakeholder agents for guidance
- [ ] Justified any technical debt introduction
- [ ] Created follow-up tasks for any deferred improvements
- [ ] Achieved solution that will remain viable long-term

## Repository Structure

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER** initialize new repositories
**Main Repository**: `/workspace/branches/main/code/` (git repository and main development branch)
**Task Worktrees**: `/workspace/branches/{task-name}/code/` (isolated per task-protocol.md)
**Locks**: Multi-instance coordination via lock files in `/workspace/locks/`

**Git Configuration**:
- Main worktree has `receive.denyCurrentBranch=updateInstead` (allows atomic pushes)
- Task worktrees fetch from and push to main worktree
- All pushes are atomic and concurrency-safe via git's internal locking

## üîß CONTINUOUS WORKFLOW MODE

Override system brevity for comprehensive multi-task automation via 7-phase Task Protocol.

**Trigger**: `"Work on the todo list in continuous mode."`
**Auto-Detection**: "todo list", "all tasks", "continuously", "CONTINUOUS WORKFLOW MODE"
**Effects**: Detailed output, automatic task progression, full stakeholder analysis, comprehensive TodoWrite tracking

## üìù CODE POLICIES

**For complete code policies, see**: [docs/optional-modules/code-policies.md](docs/optional-modules/code-policies.md)

**Quick Reference**:
- **Code Comments**: Update outdated comments, avoid implementation history
- **TODO Comments**: Implement, remove, or document - never superficially rename
- **JavaDoc**: Manual process required, no automated scripts
- **TestNG Tests**: Thread-safe patterns only, no @BeforeMethod
- **Exception Types**: AssertionError = valid input reaches impossible state (our bug), IllegalStateException = wrong API usage, IllegalArgumentException = invalid input

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOL USAGE BEST PRACTICES

**For complete tool usage guide, see**: [docs/optional-modules/tool-usage.md](docs/optional-modules/tool-usage.md)

**Critical Patterns**:
- **Edit Tool**: Verify whitespace before editing (tabs vs spaces)
- **Bash Tool**: Use absolute paths or combine `cd` with command
- **Pattern Matching**: Preview before replacing, use specific patterns

### Report Types and Lifecycle

**Stakeholder Reports** (`../` from code directory):
- Temporary workflow artifacts for 7-phase task protocol
- Examples: `{task-name}-technical-architect-requirements.md`, `{task-name}-style-auditor-review.md`
- **Lifecycle**: Created during task execution, cleaned up with worktree in Phase 7
- **Purpose**: Process documentation for protocol compliance

**Empirical Studies** (`docs/studies/{topic}.md`):
- Temporary research cache for pending implementation tasks
- Examples: `docs/studies/claude-cli-interface.md`, `docs/studies/claude-startup-sequence.md`
- **Lifecycle**: Persist until ALL dependent todo.md tasks consume them as input
- **Purpose**: Behavioral analysis and research studies based on empirical testing
- **Cleanup Rule**: Remove after all dependent tasks complete implementation

**Project Code**: Task code directory (`src/`, `pom.xml`, etc.)

### Report File Naming Convention
See **"MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENT"** patterns in [docs/project/task-protocol.md](docs/project/task-protocol.md) for exact agent report naming conventions by phase.

**Note**: The `../` path writes reports to `/workspace/branches/{task-name}/` (task root), not inside the code directory.

## üìù RETROSPECTIVE DOCUMENTATION POLICY

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT create retrospective documentation files that chronicle fixes, problems, or development process.

**PROHIBITED DOCUMENTATION PATTERNS**:
‚ùå Post-implementation analysis reports (e.g., `protocol-violation-prevention.md`)
‚ùå "Lessons learned" documents chronicling what went wrong and how it was fixed
‚ùå Debugging chronicles or problem-solving narratives
‚ùå Development process retrospectives or meta-documentation
‚ùå Fix documentation that duplicates information already in code/commits

**RATIONALE**:
- Code and commit messages are the primary record of changes
- Git history provides the full development timeline
- Retrospective documents create maintenance burden without user value
- Documentation should serve future developers, not chronicle past problems

**PERMITTED DOCUMENTATION** (only when explicitly required):
‚úÖ Task explicitly requires documentation creation
‚úÖ User explicitly requests specific documentation
‚úÖ Forward-looking architecture documentation
‚úÖ API documentation and user guides
‚úÖ Technical design documents for upcoming features

**EXAMPLES**:

**PROHIBITED**:
```
docs/project/protocol-violation-prevention.md - "Analysis of violations and fixes"
docs/debugging/parallel-processing-issues.md - "How we debugged concurrency"
docs/lessons/picocli-reflection-removal.md - "Story of migrating to programmatic API"
```

**PERMITTED** (with explicit requirement):
```
docs/project/architecture.md - Forward-looking system design
docs/api/file-processor.md - API documentation for users
README.md - User-facing project documentation
```

**ENFORCEMENT**: Before creating any `.md` file in `/docs/`, verify it serves future users/developers rather than documenting the past.
